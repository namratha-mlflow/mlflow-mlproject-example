We use an operational control approach to de˜ne our \\n\\nboundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010. Emissions are recalculated back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5%  \\n\\nor greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-speci˜c data for fuel consumed and utilities purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs).  \\n\\nScope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual  \\n\\ndata collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO2 , CH4, N2 O, HFCs and PFCs. Our market-based GHG emissions include the impact  \\n\\nof renewable energy certi˜cates (RECs) purchased in the U.S. and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the U.K. All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America are  \\n\\nGreen-e certi˜ed. Emissions re˚ect supplier-speci˜c emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions re˚ect residual mix factors for European  \\n\\nfacilities. Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. \\n*The methodology to calculate Scope 3 emissions in Category 1 and 2 changed in 2016. As a result, 2016 and later emissions in these categories are not comparable to emissions in prior years. \\n\\n12Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby region\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsMetric tons CO2e75,407721,661797,06875,40786,743162,150\\nMetric tons CO2e1,47776,55978,0361,47776,55978,036EMEAMetric tons CO2e5,28135,78641,0675,2818,16413,445Latin AmericaMetric tons CO2e1312,0472,1781312,0472,178Greenhouse  \\ngas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsUnited StatesMetric tons CO2e75,253721,452796,70575,25386,534161,787IndiaMetric tons CO2e1,13948,49149,6301,13948,49149,630United KingdomMetric tons CO2e3,67731,86035,5383,6773,1346,811ChinaMetric tons CO2e16213,57713,73916213,57713,739Southeast Asia -  \\nSingapore, Malaysia, \\nPhilippines, Thailand,  \\nand IndonesiaMetric tons CO2e456,1896,234456,1896,234JapanMetric tons CO2e805,0205,100805,0205,100IrelandMetric tons CO2e5701,0651,6355701,8862,456AustraliaMetric tons CO2e81,4911,49981,4911,499ItalyMetric tons CO2e1738931,0661731,0291,201MexicoMetric tons CO2e5993799759937997South AfricaMetric tons CO2e1844346218443462RussiaMetric tons CO2e102321423102321423CanadaMetric tons CO2e1542093631542093632017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions\\n13Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissionsGermanyMetric tons CO2e02712720411412Saudi ArabiaMetric tons CO2e51982035198203BrazilMetric tons CO2e4314418743144187France\\nMetric tons CO2e112940112233Rest of world\\nMetric tons CO2e7983,4614,2587983,4774,274NOx, SOx, and other   \\nfrom direct combustionUnits \\n2010201520162017SOx Metric tons17111NOx Metric tons45252120COMetric tons56383331VOC\\nMetric tons4422PMMetric tons7233Ozone depleting substances Metric tons  \\nCFC -11e14171412Data are sourced from the Scope 1 and 2 inventory and records kept through our compliance program.

Drives Change\\n\\nResponsible investment (ﬁRIﬂ) considers how environmental, social, \\nand governance (ﬁESGﬂ) issues impact the ˜irm, the companies in \\nwhich Apollo-managed funds invest, the communities in which they \\noperate, and the world at large. At Apollo Global Management and \\nits subsidiaries (ﬁApolloﬂ), we have a long-term practice of using ESG \\nfactors in our investment management strategy and believe that \\ncareful attention to such factors makes good business sense.\\nAs applicable and appropriate, Apollo:\\nŁ  Incorporates\\n ESG issues into its investment analysis \\n and decision-making processes;\\nŁ  Engages\\n on ESG issues with applicable investments it manages;\\nŁ  Seeks\\n appropriate and applicable disclosure on \\n ESG issues by investments it manages;\\nŁ  Reports\\n on its ESG activities and progress to limited partners; and\\nŁ  Supports\\n the implementation of ESG practices \\n in the investment management industry.\\nAPOLLO™S RESPONSIBLE\\n INVESTING MISSION STATEMENT\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n\\n1Scott Kleinman\\n Co-President\\nLead Partner, \\n Private Equity \\nJim Zelter\\n Co-President\\nChief Investment O˜icer, \\nCredit\\nLaurie Medley\\n Chief Responsible \\nInvesting O˜icer\\nGeneral Counsel, \\n Private Equity\\nWe are proud to publish Apollo™s 10th Annual ESG Report. Since adopting our \\nResponsible Investing Mission Statement in 2008, Apollo has collected ESG data \\nfrom the companies owned by funds that we manage. Not only does this data \\n form the basis for our Annual ESG Reports, but it is also useful to the portfolio \\ncompanies themselves, who, with the help of outside experts and counsel, are \\nbetter positioned to drive value by identifying, monitoring, and measuring the \\nsuccess of their own ESG programs and initiatives.\\nWe appreciate that the tracking, collecting, and reporting of ESG data requires considerable time and e˚ort; \\nhowever, we believe strongly that this is not only a worthwhile exercise, but an essential one. As a ˛irm that \\n seeks out uncommon opportunities for investors, Apollo believes companies that actively manage ESG risks \\n and seize ESG opportunities are more sustainable companies that are better positioned for long-term growth \\nand success. Corporate decisions that a˚ect the environment, employees, and communities have become a \\nfocus of attention for all stakeholders, including customers, regulators, investors, and the general public. \\nApollo™s ESG Reporting Program continues to be recognized as a leader in the industry. Over the course of the \\nlast ten years, we have helped dozens of our funds™ portfolio companies to evolve from anecdotal to ˛inancial-\\nstyle reporting of ESG data, and to increasingly view ESG as a driver of value and not solely through the lenses \\nof risk management and compliance. Apollo continues to review the developing landscape of ESG reporting \\nand, with input from expert advisors, portfolio companies, and investors, to provide what we see as an industry-\\nleading methodology for evaluating companies™ ESG performance. We have come a long way in the last \\n decade, and we are excited to embark on another ten years of responsible investing at Apollo.\\nFROM APOLLO™S LEADERS \\n\\n$815,230,095donated by portfolio companies \\n to charitable organizations\\ntotal weight of waste recycled\\nApollo Celebrates \\na Decade of Achievement\\n375+19.8M\\n120\\n+37ESG webinars \\nportfolio company \\n ESG reports submitted \\n to Apolloportfolio companies that have \\nparticipated in Apollo™s ESG \\nReporting Program\\n\\ntotal weight of waste recycled\\nApollo Celebrates \\na Decade of Achievement\\n21,000\\n+19.8M\\n37945,000\\n+hours volunteered by portfolio \\ncompany employees\\n95Number of Portfolio \\n Companies Reporting\\nportfolio \\ncompany \\n site visits\\nindividual  ESG data \\n points reported \\nby portfolio \\ncompanies\\n20099201019201125201225201329201444201548201655201759201864\\n1st portfolio company \\nsite visit; 1st training \\nfor investment \\nprofessionals; \\n 1st report published \\nto investors\\n20101st Portfolio \\nCompany \\nConference \\nis held, with 24 portfolio \\ncompanies \\nrepresented\\n2011Launch of ESG \\nWebinar Series; \\n RI Committee of \\nLP Advisory Board \\nis formed\\n2012Why has Apollo spent a decade developing what we believe is the most rigorous and \\ndetailed reporting in our industry on environmental, social, and governance (ﬁESGﬂ) issues? \\nBecause Apollo sees that ESG has evolved from a source of risk to a creator of value. \\nAs one of the world™s largest alternative investment \\nmanagers, Apollo believes that consideration of ESG \\nissues is essential to companies™ success: it enhances \\ntheir ability to manage risks, including regulatory \\nand reputational risks, and identi˛ies areas for cost \\nsavings and for growth. Collecting detailed data and \\nsharing it with portfolio companies and our investment \\nprofessionals better positions them both to improve \\n ESG performance and identify the areas in which \\ncompanies are well-positioned for the future. \\nApollo™s RI Program is based on three pillars: thorough \\ndiligence of ESG risks, meaningful engagement with \\nportfolio companies post-acquisition, and annual reporting \\nof both quantitative and qualitative ESG metrics. With \\nportfolio companies that collectively employ more than \\n300,000 people, the scale and potential impact of \\nApollo™s RI Program can be considerable. \\nFor 2018, 64 portfolio companies reported more \\n than 6,000 unique ESG data points. Beyond data, \\n Apollo helps portfolio companies to achieve their \\n own ESG-related goals or targets through engagement, \\nperiodic communication, and by providing them with \\naccess to experts and to each other. Our Portfolio \\nCompany Conference, held every other year, is a central \\nnexus of information exchange across a wide range \\n of ESG issues.\\nApollo ˛irst took note of ESG issues in 2007, formalized \\nour program in 2008, published our ˛irst annual report \\nin 2010, and convened the ˛irst Portfolio Company \\nConference in 2011. In ten years, we have helped \\ndozens of our funds™ portfolio companies to evolve from \\nanecdotal to ˛inancial-style reporting of ESG data Š \\n and to evolve from a compliance and risk view of ESG \\n to seeing a new path to value, as we do. \\nAPOLLO™S DECADE \\n OF DRIVING \\n ESG PROGRESS\\n2008Apollo formalizes its \\ncommitment to RI, appoints a Chief RI \\nO˚icer, and centralizes \\nits RI Program\\n2009Apollo develops \\nand pilots a \\nportfolio company \\nengagement program \\nand endorses the \\nAmerican Investment \\nCouncil™s \\nGuidelines for Responsible \\nInvesting \\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n2\\n2nd Portfolio \\nCompany \\nConference \\nis held, with 25 portfolio \\ncompanies \\nrepresented\\n20133rd Portfolio \\nCompany Conference \\nis held, with 39 portfolio companies \\nrepresented; analysis \\nof quantitative \\nportfolio company \\n ESG data is published \\nfor the ˜irst time\\n2015Impact Measurement \\nInitiative is \\nlaunched; Apollo becomes ˜irst US-\\n based PE ˜irm to \\nwin Pantheon™s \\nGP Responsible \\nInvestment Award\\n2014Apollo™s \\nESG Digest\\n is launched; 100th portfolio \\ncompany is \\nengaged2016201775th portfolio \\ncompany site \\nvisit; 4th Portfolio \\nCompany Conference \\nis held, with 45 portfolio companies \\nrepresented; \\nportfolio company \\nESG data is \\nbenchmarked for \\n the ˜irst time\\n2018Apollo™s 10th \\nAnnual ESG \\nReport, and \\n˜irst publicly \\navailable \\n report \\n (July 2019)\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n3\\nportfolio company board \\n meetings in 2018\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n4\\nCorporate Governance \\n and Transparency\\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\nApollo introduced West Corporation to its ESG \\n and compliance reporting process soon after \\nApollo-managed funds acquired the company in \\n2017, helping the telecom to envision a program \\nof ESG excellence.

Their initiatives have included \\nmore e˚icient printing technology, water fountains \\nto decrease plastic bottle use, and an expansion of \\nthe company™s recycling program. Apollo also made \\nexperts in risk and compliance available to West, \\nwhich also undertook internal e˛orts to consolidate \\nand rationalize diverse policies from di˛erent \\ndepartments. In a major e˛ort, West surveyed every \\nemployee and interviewed more than 80 senior \\nmanagers to identify their concerns, and then \\nbegan to address these issues with the support of \\nthe company™s board and executive team. West \\nbelieves that e˛orts like these make West a better \\nplace to work and a more nimble and resilient \\ncompetitor in its markets. \\n ﬁApollo™s ESG and compliance reporting is more \\n of a resource than a task.

Portfolio companies™ \\ncompliance and risk management practices are \\nalso central to good governance, and portfolio \\ncompanies report on their codes of conduct and \\nvarious governance policies and trainings, including \\nanti-bribery policies, cybersecurity, and data privacy. \\nCorporate accountability also requires \\ntransparency:\\n setting internal goals, establishing processes to achieve \\nthem, and reporting periodically on the company™s \\nprogress. Portfolio companies are asked whether they \\nmade ESG information publicly available.

This often requires transforming how companies produce \\nand what they consume; making more e˚icient use of resources, capital, and \\ntechnology to reduce economic, environmental, and social risks. Sustainability \\nhas taken its place as a strategic business imperative that can threaten or \\nenhance a company™s long-term success.\\nApollo™s ESG program challenges portfolio companies to understand how they can improve their operations \\nby making consumption and production more e˜icient and sustainable. Companies report their \\nwater and \\nenergy consumption\\n and relevant reduction initiatives, as well as their \\nwaste production and recycling \\ndata. \\nIn 2018, 97% of portfolio companies reported having waste reduction initiatives and 63% reported recycling \\nwaste. Apollo looks for evidence of disciplined water management and water recycling and reuse, and in \\n2018, 74% of portfolio companies that use water in their operations reported these initiatives in place. \\nPortfolio companies are also asked to disclose how they monitor the sustainability of their \\nsupply chains\\n to \\nreduce both economic and reputational risk. In 2018, 69% of portfolio companies reported having a supplier \\ncode of conduct or a responsible contractor policy in place or in development. Many portfolio companies \\nalso incorporate provisions against child and forced labor in their contracts with suppliers, and conduct site \\nvisits to ensure compliance.\\nVerallia, acquired by Apollo-managed funds in 2015, is one of the world™s leading \\nmanufacturers of glass packaging for food and beverages. As the company strives to \\nprovide healthy and attractive glass packaging, it is proud to be a leader in sustainable \\nconsumption and production. Customers today are looking to suppliers who can help \\nminimize their environmental footprint, making glass an attractive choice for many. \\nIn˜initely recyclable, glass bottles and jars are collected and recycled to become new food \\ncontainers all over again. Since committing itself to reducing its environmental footprint \\nseveral years ago, Verallia has invested in seven household glass processing centers, \\n and continues its e˛orts to use as much recycled glass as possible in its furnaces. \\nCase Study\\n Verallia, Courbevoie, France\\n ﬁGlass is a 100% recyclable material, and recycled glass (cullet) is a main element in our production.

Apollo also asks portfolio \\ncompanies to report on \\nenergy and fuel consumption and cost\\n, on reduction programs, \\nand on the goals or targets they achieved. Apollo also facilitates an annual GHG emission \\ncalculation webinar, where climate experts engage with portfolio companies to help \\nidentify and calculate their GHG emissions, then provide them with industry-speci˛ic \\nresources to better understand their climate-related risks. \\nAcquired by Apollo-managed funds in 2018, Sun Country Airlines has set a goal to reduce its fuel \\nconsumption by 736,000 gallons in 2019. The company™s 14 new technological and business \\ninitiatives to achieve that goal have already begun to show results: from Q1 2018 to Q1 2019, the \\nairline reduced its gallons per passenger by 12%. Removing redundant ovens and co˛ee makers from \\nplanes, and installing new, lightweight seats, has cut aircraft weight Š the primary driver of fuel \\nburn Š while new software and procedures, such as using only one engine while taxiing, have also \\ncontributed to savings. The airline™s ﬁSoaring to Sustainabilityﬂ initiative aims for zero waste, including \\nwaste collected on aircraft.

This understanding is core to our approach to sustainable \\n˜nance, which is grounded in two key pillars Š inclusive growth and climate transition Š that we apply to our work with \\nclients and our business.At the same time that the business case for sustainable growth has crystallized, the consequences of inaction have also \\nbecome more apparent. This is a rare moment where the pull of opportunity, and the push of risk, are driving market \\nparticipants in the same direction, toward sustainable growth.\\nWhile we have been engaged in sustainable ˜nance for the better part of two decades, 2019 represents a notable surge \\n in momentum. During the year, we announced the formation of the Sustainable Finance Group to drive our efforts across \\n our businesses. Our ambitions in this area are sizable. We have set a target of $750 billion in ˜nancing, advisory and \\ninvesting activity over the next 10 years across these themes of climate transition and inclusive growth. As signi˜cantly, \\n we are weaving these capabilities across the ˜rm, encompassing both how our divisions serve our clients and how we \\nmanage ourselves as an organization. \\nSustainable ˜nance was front and center across our client interactions in 2019. We will go deeper into several examples \\n in the pages that follow, but a few examples are worth highlighting here. We worked with Enel to issue the ˜rst-ever general \\ncorporate purpose bond that links the payment of its coupon to the company™s goal of generating at least 55 percent of its \\npower from renewables by the end of 2021. We created a new corporate cash management solution that prioritizes business \\nwith diverse broker-dealers. And we established a new policy to only take public those companies in the US and Europe with \\nat least one diverse board director (starting next year, we will increase our target to two). We also continued to deepen the \\nintegration of sustainable ˜nance within our core work, from how we make and manage private equity investments, to how \\nwe steward assets as an active shareholder. Sustainable ˜nance has been a powerful application of our One Goldman Sachs \\napproach Š mobilizing our best thinking across the ˜rm on central questions for some of our largest clients. \\nThis report arrives in the midst of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has already \\nhad a devastating impact on societies around the world. We have seen historic \\nlevels of jobless claims, record volatility in the markets, and unprecedented \\ndisruption to all aspects of our day-to-day lives. While so much remains \\nuncertain about the course of the virus, what is clear is that we will be dealing \\nwith its effects for many months, and likely much longer. \\nFELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,(from left to right)John E.

By leveraging our commercial expertise to \\ncatalyze market-driven solutions, Goldman Sachs is committed to helping our clients and stakeholders accelerate \\n the transition to a low-carbon economy in an inclusive and orderly way.\\nOur approach to climate change encompasses a holistic view of commercial solutions to mitigate climate risk \\nand capture opportunities that promote environmental progress across growth areas in clean energy, sustainable \\ntransport, food and agriculture, waste and materials, and ecosystem services. Through innovative approaches to \\nclimate, combined with our deep market expertise across these themes, we are at the forefront of advising clients \\n on their climate transition strategies, thereby helping markets and economies capture sustainable growth. \\n\\n11Despite advancing efforts on many \\nfronts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, \\nclimate impacts will be unavoidable. \\n As a result, an equal emphasis needs to be \\nplaced on climate resiliency and adaptation, \\nwhich is the focus of a $700 million \\nbond issuance by the European Bank for \\nReconstruction and Development (EBRD). \\nGoldman Sachs has been at the forefront \\nin developing catastrophe bonds, which are \\ndebt instruments designed to raise money \\nin the event of natural disasters, including \\nfrom extreme weather events. From there, \\nit was a natural step to the development \\nof the ˜rst resiliency bond, a new category \\nof green bond based on a set of climate resilience principles established by the \\nClimate Bonds Initiative, an international \\norganization that is mobilizing the bond market to support a low-carbon and climate-\\nresilient economy.\\nThe offering is an outgrowth of a 2018 \\nClimate Bonds Initiative meeting that \\nbrought together experts in resilience and \\nclimate adaptation. As a result, principles \\naround these issues were added to existing \\nstandards and certi˜cation criteria, which \\nthe Initiative had been applying to green \\nbonds since 2015. Goldman Sachs served \\non the advisory board and helped develop \\nthe principles.Goldman Sachs has been a leader in the development of innovative ˜nancing approaches that drive capital \\ntoward green and social projects. The past year™s activity had a number of notable ˜rsts, including those that \\nprovide new solutions that can be scaled across the market.\\nWorking with Enel, an Italian-headquartered energy company,\\n Goldman Sachs structured the ˜rst sustainability performance bond linked to the United \\nNations™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rather than restrict the use \\n of proceeds to speci˜c green projects, the bond ties Enel™s cost of capital to \\n its strategic commitment to make installed capacity 55% renewable by the end \\nof 2021 Š core to the company™s broader decarbonization strategy, including \\nits long-term goal of net-zero emissions. Under the bond™s performance-based \\ncovenant, investors receive a step up in interest rates if the target is not met. \\nIssued in September 2019, Enel™s $1.5 billion inaugural SDG-linked bond was \\npreceded by robust discussions with investors on the innovative structure, \\nand followed in October by a •2.5 billion similar offering.

The proceeds \\nwill be dedicated to scaling efforts to protect some 5 million acres of the nation™s working forests, \\nmitigating climate change, protecting ecosystems and strengthening rural communities.\\nFIRST GREEN \\nBOND FOR US \\nCONSERVATION\\nGoldman Sachs facilitated climate-focused green \\n and sustainability bond issuances for two of the largest \\ncompanies in the world Š PepsiCo and Sysco. \\nPepsiCo™s ˜rst-ever green bond aims to support \\ndecarbonizing the company™s global operations and supply \\nchain and investing in advanced packaging and water \\nsustainability. The $1 billion issuance that we helped \\nunderwrite in 2019 drew strong market support, with \\ngrowing investor interest in ESG-linked securities. PepsiCo \\nintends to use the proceeds to pursue a wide range  of initiatives, including greater use of renewable energy, \\n water replenishment in high-water-risk regions, and \\ninvestments in sustainable product packaging.\\nSysco, the international food distributor, became \\n the second US company to issue a sustainability \\n bond, which allocates proceeds to both green and \\nsocial projects. In February 2020, we structured \\n a $1 billion issuance for Sysco, which included \\n $500 million in sustainability bonds. The sustainability \\nbond portion will support a wide range of initiatives, \\nincluding procurement of sustainably harvested \\n food, investments in more sustainable water \\nmanagement, and sourcing clean energy, as the \\ncompany seeks to use renewable sources through \\nlong-term power purchase agreements for a portion \\n of its energy needs.

In this case, the asset is River \\nOuest, a 690,000-square-foot of˜ce building \\nin the western suburbs of Paris with a ﬁvery \\ngoodﬂ rating from BREEAM, a sustainability \\nassessment method for rating buildings, \\ninfrastructure and master planning projects. The \\n•186 million mortgage-backed issuance gives \\nasset managers the opportunity to invest in \\n a securitized product with green collateral.\\n\\n14Brightmark is a San FranciscoŒbased global waste \\n solutions provider whose projects include turning \\nplastic waste into transport fuels and other useful \\nproducts.\\n Through a $185 million ˜nancing Goldman Sachs \\nfacilitated, Brightmark is building and plans to operate a \\nnew Plastics Renewal plant in Ashley, Indiana, that will turn \\n100,000 tons of scrap plastic into 18 million gallons of \\n ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, naphtha blend stocks and nearly \\n6 million gallons of commercial-grade wax. The company \\nwill employ the process of pyrolysis, or plastics renewal, \\nwhich uses heating to decompose post-use plastic in \\n an environment with limited oxygen. This process is seen \\nas a key solution to both reducing petrochemical production \\nand plastic waste in markets around the world. \\nBig River Steel, an advanced recycler and steelmaker \\n in northeast Arkansas,\\n and the ˜rst steel producer in  the US that is LEED-certi˜ed, will use a $487 million \\nindustrial bond offering structured by Goldman Sachs to \\nexpand scrap metal recycling and production of ˚at-rolled \\nsteel. This will set the stage for downstream investment, \\nincluding the production of higher-grade electrical steel, \\ndemand for which is expected to grow as electric-vehicle \\nproduction ramps up. Big River Steel™s Flex Mill technology, \\nalong with its focus on machine learning and data analytics, \\nallows it to produce some of the most demanding steel \\ngrades at a competitive cost.\\nExpansion of recycling and reuse is among the most important ways to ˜ght climate change by limiting \\ndependence on new materials and reducing waste. Whether through capital raising or direct investment, we \\nhave helped drive the circular economy by enabling companies involved to innovate and scale operations.\\nDEPLOYING CAPITAL \\n TO ADVANCE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\n15We saw an under-addressed \\n market opportunity in small and mid-\\n sized commercial and industrial solar Š \\n helping companies, cities, schools and hospitals \\ninstall solar on their rooftops. Based on our \\nassessment, the opportunity was a good ˜t for \\n our ˜rm™s network of relationships, expertise in \\n risk management in energy markets, and strength \\n in evaluating and managing credit risk. From that \\nfoundation, we formed the GSAM Renewable \\n Power Group, a team of roughly 35 experienced \\nprofessionals that invests in renewable energy \\nassets. This model allows us to partner with clients \\n to own and manage projects across the United \\nStates that deliver clean energy, and in turn, to \\n sell the power produced by these assets under \\n long-term agreements to energy users. Currently, the GSAM Renewable Power Group \\n is among the largest owners and operators of \\ndistributed renewable generation assets in the United \\nStates with over 1 gigawatt of operating capacity. The \\nGroup currently manages equity capital of approximately \\n$1.9 billion, and expects to deploy approximately \\n $4 billion of total capital, including $500 million from \\n a green bond offering in December 2019. \\nThe GSAM Renewable Power Group partnered with \\none of the largest solar developers, SunPower, to build \\nNew York City™s largest solar project at JFK Airport. \\nOnce completed, the project will allow surrounding \\ncommunities to access solar energy at reduced rates. Besides reducing JFK™s greenhouse gas emissions \\n by approximately 7,000 tons annually (equivalent \\n to taking about 1,400 cars off the road), the project is \\nexpected to lower the Port Authority™s greenhouse gas \\nemissions at the airport by around 10 percent The \\nGSAM Renewable Power Group will hold the power \\npurchase agreement for the project, while SunPower \\nwill develop and construct the infrastructure at JFK. \\nINVESTING TO SCALE \\n CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES \\n FUELING GROWTH IN \\n DISTRIBUTED POWER \\nIn 2019, a fund managed by our Merchant Bank, alongside Volkswagen Group and BMW, \\n led a $1 billion equity capital raise for Northvolt, a Swedish supplier of sustainable, high-quality \\nlithium-ion battery cells and systems manufactured for the automotive, industrial and energy \\nstorage sectors.\\n The capital raise underpinned the ˜nancing of the ˜rst 16 GWh of Northvolt™s ˜rst \\ngigafactory, which will be powered by 100% renewable electricity with plans for a co-located battery \\nrecycling facility, which will deliver the world™s greenest lithium-ion battery with a minimal CO\\n2 footprint. \\nFurther supporting the equity ˜nancing and subsequent debt ˜nancing process, Northvolt \\nsigned a number of supply agreements with a combined order value over $13 billion through \\n2030. In addition to the Swedish primary facility, Northvolt also formed a joint venture with \\nthe Volkswagen Group to establish a 16 GWh battery cell gigafactory in Germany, which \\n will bring Volkswagen™s total investment in Northvolt to around $1 billion.\\nPOWERING A REVOLUTION IN BATTERY TECH\\n\\n16Twiga Foods is a Kenyan end-to-end distributor of fresh and processed food.\\n Through Goldman \\n Sachs™ investment in the company, Twiga Foods is developing proprietary technology and logistical assets \\nto support its distribution system, which enables improved sustainability of the food and agriculture value \\nchain and allows farmers to be paid within 48 hours via mobile platforms. The investment is laying the \\ngroundwork for expansion to cities across Africa, helping to drive sustainable access to lower-cost, \\n higher-quality food and improved economic security for farmers.\\nSUSTAINABLE \\nFOOD AND AGRICULTURE\\nFEEDING THE PLANET \\nSUSTAINABLY \\nDRIVING FOOD SECURITYAmid a growing focus on human health, climate change, resource \\nconservation and animal welfare, \\nGoldman Sachs led the $277 million IPO \\n of Beyond Meat. Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in \\n the United States offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. Founded \\nin 2009, Beyond Meat has a mission of building meat directly from plants, an \\ninnovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other \\nsensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying \\n the nutritional and environmental bene˜ts of eating its plant-based meat \\n products. As of December 31, 2019, Beyond Meat™s portfolio of fresh and \\n frozen plant-based proteins was sold at approximately 77,000 retail, restaurant \\n and foodservice outlets in more than 65 countries worldwide.\\n\\n17DIFFERENTIATED \\nESG \\nINVESTING STRATEGIES\\nExpanding the Opportunities  \\nESG and impact investments continue to gain momentum driven by rapidly \\nrising demand from institutional and individual investors. We continue to develop our capabilities in delivering \\ninnovative and differentiated investment strategies, including those focused on renewable energy and \\ndecarbonization. At GSAM, ESG assets under supervision increased from $17 billion in December 2018 to \\n $74 billion in December 2019. \\nIn 2019, GSAM raised assets for an equity strategy that invests in companies focused on environmental \\nimpact, with themes that range from renewable energy Š \\nincluding solar, wind, bioenergy and smart grid \\nservices Š to electric and autonomous vehicles and sustainable food production. \\nThe strategy assumes that, in ˜ghting climate change, government-led approaches will undershoot key targets Š \\nand that private sector innovation will be critical to meeting the climate challenge. It also assumes that companies \\nthat successfully provide new solutions have signi˜cant upside, and that institutional and individual investors \\nseek the opportunity to take part in that potential. \\nThe strategy leverages our deep experience in ESG investment and our proprietary approach to weighing ESG \\nfactors, risks and opportunities.\\nRecognizing that environmental factors\\n can affect investment \\nperformance and represent potential investment risk, GSAM has prioritized \\nengagement on climate change-related issues, including environmental \\ndisclosure, climate risk and carbon reduction commitments. For example, \\nin 2019, the GSAM Global Stewardship Team had ongoing engagement \\nwith a Japanese railway company, which resulted in enhanced internal \\nESG oversight and improved disclosure.\\nFUNDAMENTAL \\nEQUITY \\n STRATEGY \\nCLIMATE CHANGE \\nENGAGEMENTŁ Low-carbon passive equity portfolioŁ Climate risk frameworkŁ Stewardship / Engagement\\nŁ Operational Ef˜ciencyŁ Climate-focused private market investmentsŁ Thematic public equity investmentsPROBABILITY DENSITY\\nRETURNSKey Potential Value Drivers\\nImplementation options across asset classesFor illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as research, investment advice or a recommendation.

In February 2020, Goldman Sachs joined as a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), a policy organization representing the broadest coalition on climate in the US supporting a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend plan as a pragmatic and ef˜cient solution for reducing GHG emissions and addressing climate change. In December 2019, our CEO David Solomon also published an editorial that underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and sustainable growth and called for governments to put a price on the cost of carbon. Carbonomics, a report issued in December by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, analyzes the cost curve of decarbonization through almost 100 different technologies. The report identi˜es an abundance  of large, low-cost investment opportunities in power generation, industry, \\ntransport, buildings and nature-based solutions that can support  $1Œ2 trillion dollars of decarbonization investments annually, creating \\n new jobs, higher energy security and lower pollution. Reducing net  carbon emissions quickly and effectively will demand a combination of carbon pricing, technology and CO2 sequestration. The report describes  how capital markets already play a leading role by ˜nancing the energy transition while reducing investments in hydrocarbon development, fostering consolidation in a ﬁnew age of restraintﬂ for the hydrocarbon industry, and the evolution of large companies from Big Oil to Big Energy \\nas they become broader, cleaner energy providers.\\nCarbon Pricing:\\nA Market-Oriented Emissions \\nReduction Strategy\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘ˆˇ˝˘˝˚˘ˆ\\n˘ˆ˙ˆˆ˘\\n˘ˆ˘\\n˘†“‘˘ˆˇ˝˘\\n˘\\n˘\\n\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇˆ˘\\n\\n˜˜˜˜\\n˜˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘\\n˘\\n˝˛\\n˝\\n\\n˘\\n˘\\n˘˙ˆˇ˘\\n˘\\n˘˙˘\\n\\n˝˛˝ˆˇ˛˝\\n\\n˘\\n˘˛˛˝ˆ˝˚ˆ˚˝˚˚˛˝˛˛˝˛˝\\n˚ˇ˛˘ˆˇ˘ˆˇ˝˛\\n˘‘˘\\n˘\\nˆ˝\\n˘’˘\\n\\n˘\\n˘ˆ\\n\\n20In addition to our work with clients, we continue to inform broader market approaches by leveraging \\nour insights through thought leadership and partnerships.ADVANCING \\nTHE ECOSYSTEM\\nUnderpinning the potential for broader scale and impact across inclusive growth and climate \\ntransition themes is a need for good data. \\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is \\npartnering with corporates and investors alike to drive the adoption of ˜nancially material, market-informed \\ndata that is industry speci˜c. Goldman Sachs was the ˜rst major US ˜nancial institution and the ˜rst global \\ninvestment bank to report under SASB standards in 2019 and GSAM is a long-standing member of the \\nSASB Alliance and SASB™s Investor Advisory Group.\\nIn 2019, GSAM teamed up\\n with a select group of other leading asset managers to advance climate-\\nrelated investment among national sovereign wealth \\nfunds (SWFs). Known as the One Planet Asset \\nManagers Initiative, this collaboration supports \\nthe efforts of the One Planet SWF Working Group, \\ncomposed of leading SWFs, to drive a deeper \\nconsideration of the impact of climate change on \\ninvestment portfolios. We believe that, while more \\nSWFs are incorporating sustainability into their \\nportfolios, broadening sets of investment options and \\napproaches can accelerate the trend, further bridging \\nthe gap between policy and portfolio objectives.\\nIn January 2019, Goldman Sachs joined the CEO-led Climate Finance \\nLeadership Initiative (CFLI)\\n as one of seven founding members alongside Allianz, \\nAXA, ENEL, GPIF, HSBC and Macquarie. CFLI was established by Michael R. \\nBloomberg, in his capacity as the UN Secretary-General™s Special Envoy for Climate \\nAction, to support greater mobilization of climate ˜nance ˚ows around the world. In \\nSeptember 2019, CFLI delivered the \\nFinancing the Low-Carbon Future\\n report to the \\nUN, outlining ways to further mobilize private climate ˜nance at the scale and speed \\nneeded to support a rapid and orderly transition to a low-carbon global economy.\\nQUANTIFYING IMPACT \\n AND PERFORMANCE \\nPARTNERING WITH \\nASSET OWNERSSCALING \\n CLIMATE \\n FINANCE\\nINCLUSIVE GROWTHIt is imperative that the global economy generate growth that is more inclusive\\n Š that enables  people to contribute to society, expands the middle class, and helps businesses and communities grow. \\n Our ˜rm is focused on driving a range of inclusive growth opportunities, spanning innovative ˜nancial \\nproducts and services that reach more people, expanded access to education and healthcare, as well as \\ngreater investment in housing and infrastructure development in underserved communities. \\nAt its core, our approach to inclusive growth draws upon innovative ideas that mitigate unequal access, \\nincrease affordability and improve quality.

In addition, even when credit \\n is available, the lending process is lengthy, with waits of up to six months for loans that often have high interest rates.\\nGoldman Sachs also led a funding round for ZestMoney, an Indian ˜ntech startup that lends to millions who lack traditional credit. \\nZestMoney enables consumers to secure loans and make online purchases while building a credit history that opens doors \\n to traditional credit markets. ZestMoney uses mobile technology, digital banking and arti˜cial intelligence to extend credit amounts \\nof $140 to $3,000 and enable users to pay back in manageable installments. To date, ZestMoney is accepted by more than 3,000 \\nmerchants, including Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm. The platform has more than 6 million users, and future plans call for entering \\nbrick-and-mortar retail as well.\\nDRIVING \\nFINANCIAL INCLUSION \\n Climb Credit makes accessible loans to people \\nstriving to improve their lives through career training.\\n Climb works with career-training and professional schools \\nwith proven track records, as measured by post-graduate \\njob placement and starting salary. The company provides \\nfunds for hundreds of courses at schools across the \\nUnited States, all evaluated for their ability to deliver the \\nknowledge and skills necessary for jobs offering solid \\nearnings and room for personal and ˜nancial growth.\\nClimb-supported courses of study range from coding \\nprograms to truck driving and heavy equipment \\noperation, nursing, dental assistance, teaching, \\ncosmetology, and many other trades and professions. \\nThe company enables learners to borrow up to the \\nfull cost of tuition and offers quick loan decisions and \\nlearner-friendly payback terms. Goldman Sachs™ Urban \\nInvestment Group (UIG), an investor in community \\n and economic development, provided a $50 million loan \\nfacility to Climb.\\nIn addition, UIG made a commitment of up to \\n$10 million to On the Road Lending,\\n a Community \\nDevelopment Financial Institution loan fund that provides \\nlow-interest loans for purchasing reliable fuel-ef˜cient \\ncars. The company focuses on underserved markets \\nthroughout the Southeast, where mass transit is largely unavailable, car transport is essential, and low-income \\nindividuals are vulnerable to predatory lending practices. \\nThis service helps reduce poverty in these areas by \\nincreasing access to quality jobs, affordable health care \\nand fresh food.\\nCLOSING THE \\n CREDIT GAP \\nSUPPORTING \\n JOB GROWTH\\n23Marcus, Goldman Sachs™ Consumer business, was created to help consumers achieve ˜nancial well-\\n being. \\nCore to this philosophy is a commitment to value, transparency and simplicity, which includes providing \\n no-fee personal loans, valuable savings products, and an intuitive digital experience, alongside access to tools and \\nresources that can help increase ˜nancial empowerment and literacy. These include savings and loan calculators \\n and educational content focused on savings, budgeting, smart use of credit and long-term ˜nancial planning. This \\ncontent covers a wide range of ˜nancial topics, from building and maintaining an emergency fund, to understanding \\nhow 529 education plans work, to strategizing for empty-nesters. \\nIn addition, in 2019 we partnered with Apple to launch a no-fee credit card that incorporates new levels of privacy, \\nsecurity and transparency, and provides tools that make it easy to analyze spending patterns over time and show \\ncustomers how to save on interest.\\nSince its launch in 2016, the Consumer business platform has attracted 5 million customers, with $7 billion in \\n loans and credit card balances and $60 billion in total deposits. In 2019, the Marcus loan program scored highest \\nin J.D. Power™s Personal Loan Customer Satisfaction Study, which gauged consumer satisfaction across four key \\nmetrics: application and approval process, billing and payments, customer interaction, and loans and terms.\\nCOVID-19 Support\\n Marcus has helped provide relief to consumers facing unexpected hardship through its customer assistance \\nprogram. During recent natural disasters Š including hurricanes and last year™s California wild˜res Š this program \\nsupported consumers as they recovered, allowing them to postpone loan payments without being charged interest. \\nIn 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges, we are focused on helping consumers through \\nMarcus and Apple Card Š allowing customers to postpone two monthly payments without accruing interest, and \\nhave early access to funds in CDs with no early withdrawal penalties. \\nCREATING A CONSUMER HUB FOR FINANCIAL \\nEMPOWERMENT AND LITERACY \\nDriving Financial Inclusion (continued)\\n24ADVANCING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION \\nŠ  A COMMERCIAL IMPERATIVE\\nResearch shows that companies that have a top \\nquartile ranking as it relates to ethnic diversity \\n of their management team \\nare 33 percent more likely to have industry-leading pro˜tability Š and \\nthat companies ranked in the top quartile for gender \\ndiversity of their management team are 21 percent \\nmore likely to outperform peers.\\n1Yet, despite this evidence, just 3 percent of US \\nventure capital goes to women-led teams, while a \\nmere 1 percent goes to black and Latinx founders. Mirroring this imbalance, lack of diversity is pronounced among venture \\n capital and private equity ˜rms. Although diverse-owned ˜rms are overrepresented in the top quartile of private equity groups, \\ndiverse asset managers have less than 1.3 percent of the $69 trillion of global assets under management.\\n2This imbalance is the impetus behind \\nLaunch With GS\\n, a $500 million investment strategy grounded in our belief that diverse \\nteams drive strong returns. \\nLaunch With GS\\n seeks to increase access to capital for women, black, Latinx, and other diverse \\nentrepreneurs and investors. Since its inception, Goldman Sachs has deployed more than $230 million to businesses with \\n diverse management teams globally Š from a software provider in Atlanta, to a ˜ntech company in Bengaluru and a pediatric \\nclinic in China. In early 2020, Launch With GS\\n announced Goldman Sachs™ ˜rst Black and Latinx Entrepreneur Cohort, which will be comprised \\n of a group of high-growth startups from across the United States. Beyond access to capital, these businesses will participate \\nin an eight-week virtual, customized experience that will include one-on-one and sector-speci˜c workshops with our research, \\nbanking and investment teams and interaction with startup experts across key areas including legal services, capitalization, \\nmarketing and branding. Members of the Cohort will engage with the Goldman Sachs network, as well as the \\nLaunch With \\nGS Advisory Council, composed of leading entrepreneurs, investors and executives. The program will culminate in an Investor \\nShowcase, where entrepreneurs will introduce their companies to an invitation-only investor audience. \\nLEVERAGING THE \\nSTRENGTHS OF DIVERSE \\nENTREPRENEURSHIPWe believe that diversity, in addition to being a social imperative, is also just good business. Increased diversity of \\nexperience, gender identity, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation reduces the risk of groupthink and unlocks creative \\nand impactful solutions. This is why we are committed to driving diversity in our work with clients and have prioritized \\nhaving a diverse and inclusive workforce Š including ambitious diversity goals for recruitment and hiring.\\n1 McKinsey, 2018. \\n2 Knight Foundation, 2019.\\n\\n25INCREASED FOCUS ON \\n BOARD DIVERSITYDRIVING BOARD DIVERSITY \\n AT THE STARTING GATE\\nAdvancing Diversity and Inclusion Š A Commercial Imperative (continued)Underscoring our conviction that diverse perspectives can have \\n a strong impact on company performance,\\n we have prioritized board \\ndiversity in our stewardship efforts. During the 2019 proxy season, \\n GSAM voted against 312 directors at 214 companies for lacking at \\nleast one woman on the board. In November 2019, GSAM contacted \\napproximately 50 companies in situations where votes were cast \\nagainst board members for lack of female representation. Through these \\nengagements, we sought information on each company™s approach to \\nrecruiting diverse talent and the potential barriers to such recruitment. \\nAs an additional example of these efforts, GSAM made engagement \\non board diversity a key feature in repositioning an $11 billion European \\nmoney market fund under its management. The fund, which also employs \\nan ESG alignment approach across various factors, has a dedicated \\nengagement focus with respect to board diversity. To encourage diversity, \\nthe GSAM Stewardship Team assesses, engages and tracks progress in \\nportfolio companies with an underrepresentation of women on the board.\\nIn 2018, when GSAM\\n repositioned a money market fund focused on the \\npurchase of US government securities, \\nincluding treasuries and agencies, the purpose was to drive diversity by \\ndirecting the fund™s trades, subject to \\nbest execution, to diverse broker-dealers. \\nOn average, during 2019, the fund used \\ndiverse broker-dealers to buy approximately \\nhalf of its assets, simultaneously helping \\nthese dealers to grow and enabling clients \\nto add a diversity-focused investment \\nsolution to their portfolios.\\nIn 2019, the fund reached $1.5 billion \\n in assets, drawing high-pro˜le investors, \\nincluding one of America™s most prominent \\ncompanies: JetBlue. JetBlue was among \\nthe ˜rst clients to join the repurposed fund, leveraging it as a vehicle to expand \\nopportunities for underrepresented ˜rms. \\nFurther underscoring our commitment to advancing diversity, we \\nannounced that, effective July 2020, we will only underwrite IPOs \\nof companies domiciled in the US and Western Europe that have at \\nleast one diverse board member. \\nWe will raise this target to two during \\n2021. We strongly believe in the business case for diversity and that \\nhaving diverse perspectives on boards leads to better governance and \\nstronger company performance for our corporate clients.\\nWhile we de˜ne diversity across multiple dimensions, one example \\n our CEO David Solomon cited as part of the announcement is that \\n the performance of public offerings of US companies with at least one \\nfemale director has signi˜cantly outperformed companies with no \\n female directors over the past four years. \\nIt is our responsibility as an advisor supporting our IPO clients to ensure \\nthat their governance structure is setting them up for long-term success, \\nparticularly as they transition to the public markets for the ˜rst time. \\n We are actively working with our clients to help them achieve and \\nsurpass these diversity targets by facilitating access to our extensive \\nnetwork of diverse board candidates, which encompasses individuals \\nrepresenting a broad de˜nition of diversity, such as race, gender, \\nethnicity and sexual orientation.\\nBOOSTING ACCESS TO \\n DIVERSE BROKER-DEALERS\\n26As one of the most expensive housing markets in the country,\\n New York City has strong \\ndemand for affordable units at a time when 44 percent of all households are ﬁrent-burdenedﬂ \\n(de˜ned as spending more than 30 percent of income on rent), and more than half of those are \\nseverely rent-burdened Š spending more than 50 percent. In 2019, we provided $88 million \\nin ˜nancing for South Point at Hunters Point South in Long Island City, NY, which is part of the \\nbroader Hunters Point South, the largest affordable housing development created in New York \\nCity since the 1970s. South Point consists of 1,132 units of mixed-income housing across two \\nbuildings with 849 permanently affordable housing units for families earning between $32,000 \\nand $128,000 a year. \\nIn addition, the project will be Enterprise Green CommunityŒcerti˜ed, using low-emissivity glass, \\nexhaust heat recovery systems, low-˚ow plumbing ˜xtures, and a water-sourced heat pump to \\nachieve 15 percent greater energy ef˜ciency than required by the city code.\\nIn the Paci˜c Northwest, we made a private investment in and are providing a debt facility \\nto Sustainable Living Partners (SLP), a real estate technology venture aimed at sustainable, \\naffordable multifamily housing using a prefabricated building technology with a distinctly \\ngreen pro˜le. SLP is the result of a joint venture between Sustainable Living Innovations \\n(SLI) of Seattle and Renova Capital Partners, a private equity ˜rm specializing in sustainable \\ninfrastructure. SLI™s innovative construction process creates mid- and high-rise multifamily \\nbuildings while incorporating features such as recycled steel trusses and energy-ef˜cient, low-\\nemission, reduced-water building systems. Furthermore, because building components arrive at \\nbuilding sites preassembled, construction takes up less room, requires less energy and creates \\nless disruption in local communities.

The development \\nwill increase OHL™s ability to provide behavioral \\nhealth and substance abuse treatment critical \\n to ˜ghting the current battle against opioid \\naddiction. In addition, it will boost economic development in the area, bringing 45 jobs to \\n a neighborhood with a 52 percent poverty rate \\nand a 37 percent unemployment rate at the \\ntime of investment closing. OHL has remained \\nopen throughout the entire COVID-19 crisis \\n and has even expanded its services, offering \\ntelehealth in its Community Health Center and \\nopening a drive-through COVID-19 testing site \\nopen to drivers and bicyclists.

The issuance is expected to aid \\nin the purchase of more than 24,000 homes for ˜rst-time buyers from \\nlow- and middle-income families and includes a mandate to accelerate \\nmortgage lending for women-led households. The social bond includes \\n a $300 million credit guarantee from the Inter-American Development \\nBank, which lowered the cost for the Republic of Ecuador. \\nThe Casa Para Todos program represents the third subsidized social \\nhousing program implemented in recent years by Ecuador. It is aligned \\nwith a number of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, \\nincluding reducing poverty, increasing access to water and sanitation, \\nreducing inequality within and among countries, and making more cities \\nand human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\\nTo help alleviate the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 \\npandemic, \\nthis year we have led over $15 billion of COVID-related bonds \\nglobally. For example, we worked with the African Development Bank to \\nissue a $3 billion Fight COVID-19 Social Bond. The bond provides support \\nand ˜nancing to countries and businesses ˜ghting against COVID-19 \\n and helps investors support African communities to curb the spread \\n of the virus and overcome the many challenges caused by the outbreak. \\nWe also underwrote the Inter-American Development Bank $2˛billion \\nSustainable Development Bond as part of their $12 billion COVID-19 \\nresponse package, the Republic of Austria •7.5 billion issuance Š \\n part of whose proceeds will support a •4 billion COVID-19 emergency \\n fund Š and the French Development Agency •1.5 billion issuance.\\nINNOVATIVE \\nFINANCING APPROACHES \\n\\n28INVESTING IN PHILANTHROPY \\n TO DRIVE GLOBAL GROWTH \\nFor areas related to inclusive growth where there is not an immediate market opportunity, we strive to develop \\nphilanthropic initiatives that level the playing ˜eld and spark economic growth in communities around the world. \\nAs a ˜rm, we approach this work with the same rigor and innovation we commit to our everyday business. \\nAcross our philanthropic programs, the ˜rm has invested more than $2.5 billion to date.\\nASSESSING THE \\nCONTINUED IMPACT \\nOF 10,000 SMALL \\nBUSINESSES IN THE \\nUS AND THE UK\\n 10,000 Small Businesses\\n US Our 10,000 Small Businesses\\n (10KSB\\n) initiative is a $500 million investment to help entrepreneurs create jobs \\n and economic opportunity by providing access to education, capital and support services to growth-oriented \\n small businesses.

It also provides access to \\n capital through partnerships with Community Development Financial Institutions and other mission-driven lenders. \\nIn 2019, \\n10KSB\\n launched a statewide program in Ohio, in partnership with four community colleges, committing \\n an additional $15 million to local small businesses and bringing the total commitment in Ohio to $30 million. \\n The program also sponsored the Presidential Forum Series in Iowa and New Hampshire. The Series invited \\n 2020 presidential candidates to discuss economic and social issues with the local community, including small \\nbusiness priorities.By the end of 2019, more than 9,100 small business owners had graduated from the program across all 50 states, \\nWashington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Graduates of \\n10KSB\\n routinely outpace the national average of revenue growth \\n and job creation of small businesses: 67 percent increase revenues within six months of graduation Š compared \\nto the 53 percent national average over the same period. Further, 47 percent create new jobs just six months after \\ngraduation, compared to the 30 percent national average over the same period. \\n\\n292019 saw continued innovations from \\n10,000 Women\\n (10KW\\n), our signature \\nprogram that empowers women entrepreneurs in communities worldwide. \\nThe \\n10KW\\n Online course enables women entrepreneurs in more regions to access \\n the program™s business curriculum. The online program, which closely follows the \\n in-person 10KW\\n experience, includes 10 modules covering a range of business topics, \\nfrom identifying opportunities for growth to ˜nancial planning, management techniques, \\nmarketing and leadership. By the end of the year, the \\n10KW\\n Online program had reached women from 170 countries. \\nIn the fall of 2019, Goldman Sachs convened a select group of \\n10KW\\n Online graduates at our headquarters for business coaching and training designed to take business \\ngrowth to the next level.

Furthermore, a variety of avenues  are provided to share pronouns, including via email signatures.2019 Managing Director Class Š  The Firm™s Most Diverse to Date\\nThis past year™s global managing director class was the \\n most diverse in the ˜rm™s history, with new managing directors \\nrepresenting 36 of˜ces around the world.promotedmillennialswomenAsianHispanic/ Latinx46526%2%62%29%blackLGBT+4%2%Ł  \\nVeterans Integration Program, which gives candidates leaving \\n the military an introduction to a ˜nancial services career\\nŁ  \\nExploratory Programs, providing LGBT+, women, ethnically \\ndiverse and social mobility candidates with the opportunity to \\nmeet our people, learn more about roles at the ˜rm, and develop \\njob-seeking skills, including networking and interviewing \\nŁ  \\nAfrica Recruiting Initiative, which identi˜es engineering talent \\nacross the continent with the goal of ˜lling summer and full-time \\nanalyst positions \\n(continued from previous page)PRONOUN INITIATIVE: THE FREEDOM TO SELF-IDENTIFY\\n2019 Campus Analyst Class Š The Firm™s Most Diverse to Date\\nwomen globally black professionals  in the Americas49%Hispanic/Latinx  in the Americasblack professionals  in the UK16%14%10%\\n36Globally, we have over 19,000 employees who participate in employee networks. \\nFrom driving \\nnew initiatives, to moments of celebration and perspective sharing, the networks lead by example and \\nwork to strengthen truly inclusive collaboration.\\nIn 2019, the ˜rm™s global Disability Interest Forum (DIF) appointed more than 50 colleagues from around the ˜rm to \\nserve as Disability Champions and regularly share best practices on disability inclusion, including tips for how our \\npeople can best support colleagues with disabilities. While external studies show that approximately 30 percent of \\nemployees have a disability, on average only 3 percent self-identify as such to their employer.\\n1 The DIF™s Champions \\nInitiative represents a commitment from the ˜rm and senior leadership to ensure colleagues with disabilities \\n feel appreciated for their diversity of thought and abilities by encouraging them to bring their whole, authentic \\nselves to work. As part of the launch of the Champions Initiative, the DIF hosted several events in London, \\n New York, Singapore and Bengaluru featuring senior leaders and experts on disabilities. The group also created \\n a list of practices on inclusion, including how to best support colleagues with disabilities in the workplace.\\nMost recently, we piloted the Bridge Initiative, a platform for leaders to engage in dialogue on experiences related \\nto race, ethnicity and personal identity Š focused on reverse mentoring.

In addition, the ˜rm™s \\nnew global parenting policy allows for 20 weeks of leave, an \\nincrease from 16 weeks in the United States, Asia Paci˜c \\nand other regions around the world.\\nThe ˜rm also introduced four weeks of paid family care \\n leave globally. This enables colleagues to care for family \\nmembers, as needed, due to serious health conditions, foster placement or military deployment. Additionally, we \\nlaunched \\nPathways to Parenthood\\n, which increases existing \\nstipends for adoption and surrogacy, and provides stipends \\nfor egg retrieval and egg donation where permitted by law. \\nAside from leave, the ˜rm supports expecting parents with \\na wide range of programs and services. These include a \\ndedicated expectant-parent coordinator who can provide \\nguidance on the ˜rm™s bene˜ts, facilities and mentoring \\nopportunities, and healthcare plan provisions that include a \\nhealthy-pregnancy program, with a focus on prenatal care, \\nlabor and delivery, and newborn care.\\nENHANCING OUR \\nSUPPORT FOR \\nEXPECTANT PARENTS\\nAt Goldman Sachs, we recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace, they need support in their personal as \\nwell as their professional lives. For this reason, we have created a strong support framework for wellness, enabling them to \\nbetter balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. The past year saw signi˜cant additions to that framework, \\nincluding increased support for expectant and new parents. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our \\npeople a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. As we grapple with the impacts of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, these resources remain available and we™ve continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with \\nthe aim of maintaining physical and mental well-being, effectiveness and cohesiveness of our global community. We rolled out \\nnew telemedicine services that provide our employees and their families with access to physicians (24/7) through live video \\nor telephone. In addition, for the rest of 2020, the ˜rm is waiving the costs of urgent care medical visits, including COVID-19 \\nconsultations. We also introduced a COVID-19 10-day family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family \\nmembers due to COVID-19 related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. \\nManagers play an important role in fostering a culture of inclusion Š \\n and training managers to build inclusivity is a continued focus.\\n For \\nexample, an online learning module for all new managers is \\nBuilding an Inclusive Environment\\n, in which managers learn to identify and address \\ncommon diversity and inclusion considerations within their teams, and to build \\na work environment that maximizes the potential of all team members. In the \\nprogram Identity Matters: Race and Ethnicity in the Workplace\\n, participants learn about how race, ethnicity and social identity can shape an individual™s \\nworkplace experience, and how dialogue about race and identity can create \\ntrust-based relationships. \\nSupport also extends to helping leaders manage family leaves and expectant \\nparents. In 2019, our Global Diversity Committee and Human Capital \\nManagement Division introduced Great Expectations: Managing Parenting-\\nRelated Leaves\\n, an eLearning program that delivers information and best \\npractices for preparing for colleagues™ time off and facilitating a successful \\nreturn to work.\\nTips gained through this training include how to encourage new parents to \\ntake the leave of absence, understanding how expecting a baby can generate \\nanxiety at home and work, and how to keep lines of communication open \\nduring leaves so that colleagues remain up to speed on new developments \\nand emerging team opportunities. \\nWe believe managers play a critical role in ensuring that working parents \\n have the support and resources they need to thrive in the workplace Š and \\nthat they understand that the ˜rm, and its managers, are there to support \\nthem throughout the process.HELPING MANAGERS \\nSTRENGTHEN A CULTURE OF \\nINCLUSION AND SUPPORT\\n38ENGAGING OUR PEOPLE \\n TO DRIVE IMPACT\\nEntrepreneurship and innovation have always been a core \\npart of the Goldman Sachs culture. \\nWe believe in cultivating an \\nenvironment where our people can work together, think big and \\nshape the future with their ideas.\\nGS Accelerate\\n is an initiative to foster innovation and collaboration \\nat the ˜rm. The program provides our people with capital, \\nresources and support to build new businesses and products, \\nwith a focus on future growth. Past submissions have focused on \\ndigitizing work˚ows, entering new or underpenetrated markets \\n and creating new strategies to better serve our clients.\\nIn 2020, we are inviting pitches to six key business opportunities. \\nﬁCreating a More Sustainable Futureﬂ is highlighted as one of \\nthese where we are looking for innovative ways to advance \\nsustainable economic growth and combat climate change. \\nNow in its third year, \\nGS Accelerate\\n has provided resources for \\n 13 projects, including new ideas about digital assets, alternatives \\nand communication across the ˜rm.

Last year, we completed our ˜rst power purchase agreement for on-site power \\ngeneration Š through solar carports at the new headquarters of our Ayco subsidiary in upstate \\nNew York, meeting 60 percent of the building™s electrical needs.\\nEV100 (Electric Vehicle):\\n Goldman Sachs has also begun a ˜rmwide push to support electric \\ntransport, installing 119 EV chargers at our Bengaluru campus for EV-driving employees and ground \\ntransportation vendors. Our Ayco headquarters also installed EV chargers, and we™re committed to \\ninstalling EV infrastructure in all ˜rm-owned of˜ces that provide parking, and encouraging landlords \\nto do the same in the of˜ces we lease.\\nEP100 (Energy Productivity):\\n Goldman Sachs recognizes that reducing our energy consumption \\nand operating ef˜cient of˜ces is a critical component of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The \\n˜rm™s commitment to EP100 is aligned with the ﬁNet Zero Carbon Buildingﬂ compliance pathway, \\nwhich will focus on reducing the impacts of our global real estate portfolio, by consolidating into \\nmore ef˜cient real estate, retro˜tting existing spaces to LEED Gold or equivalent standards, or \\ncreating green campuses. Our new BREEAM ﬁExcellentﬂ certi˜ed London of˜ce has achieved a \\n50 percent reduction in utility consumption compared to our previous campus due to 100 percent \\nLED lighting. Additionally, we have retro˜tted lighting at our New York and New Jersey of˜ces \\n with LEDs, saving approximately 6 million kWh of electricity use per year.\\nReducing Our Operational Impacts (continued)A THREE-WAY PATH TO \\n ENERGY TRANSFORMATION\\n\\n41In 2019, we further advanced our strategy to \\nbuild a sustainable supply chain.\\n We piloted an \\nESG self-assessment survey with 80 vendors in \\nindustries perceived to have the highest ESG risk \\nexposure to better understand the controls \\n in place to manage environmental, labor and \\nhuman rights requirements detailed in our \\nVendor Code of Conduct. And we are leveraging \\nthese ˜ndings to further enhance our responsible supply chain practices. Our goals for the coming \\nyear also include a deeper assessment of \\nvendors in industries exposed to high risk of \\nslavery and human traf˜cking.\\nA key priority for our ˜rm is fostering opportunities \\nwith small, as well as women- and minority-\\nowned, businesses, with the aim of achieving \\na supply chain that re˚ects the diversity of our \\npeople and our clients. In 2019, we focused on \\nincreasing the ˜rm™s network and access to \\ndiverse businesses, expanding our memberships \\nwith certifying agencies. In 2020, we will enhance \\nour reporting capabilities and we will \\nremain focused on our 2025 goals.\\nWe are committed to diverting 100 percent of business waste \\n from land˜ll by the end of 2020.\\n Our responsible waste management \\npractices prioritize reducing the amount of waste we generate, \\nmaximizing recycling and composting, and utilizing waste-to-energy \\nfacilities where available. In 2019, the ˜rm made signi˜cant efforts \\n toward these commitments.\\nPaper:\\n We launched \\n#goDigital\\n, a campaign to eliminate 10 million print \\npages of output annually from our operations. Opportunities to reduce \\nconsumption range from eliminating paper-based client communications \\nto fully leveraging digital media for internal communications and reducing \\nreliance on printed promotional material. In addition, we eliminated paper \\ncups in our of˜ces and shifted to reusable mugs, eliminating more than \\n200 tons of waste annually. \\nPlastics: We met our commitment to remove 85 percent of single-use \\nplastics from our global operations, including plastic bottles and straws, \\nand plastic ˜lm presentation covers and binders.\\nFood:\\n We are also working to reduce food waste in our cafeterias and \\nmicro-market cafes. In January 2019, we began to partner with Rethink \\nFood in New York to ensure that excess, unused food is donated and \\ntransitioned into ready-to-eat, nutrition-dense meals. Through this \\npartnership, and collaboration with the Conrad Hotel, we were able \\n to transform more than 32,000 pounds of food into the equivalent of \\n45,000 meals for New York City families in need. \\nFurniture:\\n We responsibly managed the disposal of 30,000 pieces \\n of existing furniture when moving from our legacy campus in London \\n to Plumtree Court Š ensuring nothing was \\n sent to land˜ll. By partnering with Waste \\nMatch, we are donating more than \\n 9,000 pieces of furniture to local charities, \\nschools and medical establishments, \\n while responsibly recycling an additional \\n 500 tons of metal. \\nE-Waste:\\n We partnered with eWorks, \\n a certi˜ed electronics recycling and \\nrefurbishment services company that \\ncreates employment opportunities \\n for those with disabilities.

Our \\nFramework includes a number of basic tenets:\\nŁ  \\nWe manage environmental and social risks with the same care \\n and discipline as we do other business risks\\nŁ  \\nWe weigh environmental and social impacts in all relevant \\n business selection decisionsŁ  \\nWe engage with clients to identify signi˜cant ESG issues, and \\n help them adopt appropriate safeguards and sustainable practices \\n where feasible\\nŁ  \\nWe decline assignments when client engagement is not possible, \\nwhen potential impacts cannot be mitigated, and when unacceptable \\nrisks con˚ict with our environmental and social policy guidelines\\nOur Framework also helps us work with clients to develop \\nenvironmental and social risk disclosures as appropriate. In addition, \\nwe proactively monitor developments Š from emerging ESG issues \\nto evolving best practices Š and periodically review and update our \\nguidelines to re˚ect these developments.\\nGoldman Sachs was one of the ˜rst ˜nancial institutions to underscore \\nthe urgency of addressing climate change through our EPF. We \\ncontinue to enhance environmental and social risk management \\nguidelines for carbon-intense sectors. This includes no direct ˜nancing \\nof new coal-˜red power plant development globally without carbon \\ncapture-and-storage technology, no direct ˜nancing of new thermal coal \\nmine development, and no new ˜nancing that directly supports new \\nupstream Arctic oil exploration or development. We work with clients \\nacross all industries on climate transition, including with power sector \\nclients to help them diversify and reduce GHG emissions to transition \\nin-line with the Paris Agreement.\\nBecause risk management is so critical to responsibly running our ˜rm, \\nwe focus on training our people in risk management globally, including \\ntraining with respect to environmental and social risk. As our ˜rst line \\nof defense, our people undergo specialized training by sector and \\nindustry, particularly in sectors we believe have higher potential for \\nenvironmental and social risk.\\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\nOUR RISK MANAGEMENT\\nDeals Reviewed (2019)\\nFor Environmental and Social Risks1,612\\nPotential Transactions Reviewed\\n1 ﬂOtherﬂ includes agriculture, biotech, housing, palm oil and transactions for ˜nancial sponsors related to loan portfolios across various sectors. \\nOil & GasPower GenerationMetals & MiningChemicalsTransportation\\nOther1Water \\nInfrastructure ForestryBiofuelsSector (2019)\\n61734125541201958830187\\n44Goldman Sachs supports the work of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a market-driven initiative aimed at \\ncreating a voluntary, consistent global framework for providing information on climate-related ˜nancial risks to investors, lenders, insurers \\n and other stakeholders.Launched after the Paris Agreement by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global ˜nancial system, TCFD reporting provides decision-useful information that improves the understanding and analysis of material \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities. In this spirit, Goldman Sachs has published an inaugural report (see page 56) that details our approach \\nto managing climate-related risks and opportunities across our businesses and operations, including the initial steps we have taken on \\ntransition and physical climate-risk scenario analysis. Our approach is multifaceted across both opportunities and risks and continues to advance as both the market and our clients™ needs evolve and as data, technology and tools improve over time. Since our initial 2005 Environmental Policy Framework (EPF), we have continued to \\nintegrate climate change risk mitigation and opportunities across our ˜rm. The report covers a range of topics.\\nAmong the highlights:Managing Risks (continued)Governance How the management and oversight of climate change is integrated across our existing governance structure, including at the management and Board level. Our approach ensures that climate change is strategically managed and the expertise of the ˜rm is both integrated and leveraged across relevant committees and functions.Strategy How we™ve built on the roadmap laid out in our EPF, by establishing the Sustainable \\nFinance Group in 2019 and a cross-divisional Steering Group to deepen our expertise and deliver that expertise to our clients. Also, how in 2019, we announced a new sustainable ˜nance target of $750 billion of ˜nancing, investing and advisory activity by 2030 and will continue to work with clients across sectors globally to accelerate climate transition in an orderly and inclusive way.\\nRisk Management How climate risk is integrated into our existing risk management as well as the initiatives we are undertaking to further integrate climate-related factors and scenarios into our risk management and business selection processes, including initial scenario analysis of (1) transition risk for our balance sheet-related equity and credit assets and (2) physical risk for our global properties. Over time, our goal is to both re˜ne the methodology and assumptions and expand the scope of analysis. Metrics and Targets\\n Going forward, we will monitor and report capital deployed in clean energy as one of the nine growth themes underlying our $750 billion sustainable ˜nance goal, and the progress we make against new operational targets we have set for 2025, with a focus on strategic, collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation.Risk management is integrated throughout the ˜rm. In our advisory, \\n˜nancing and investing activity, we focus on transaction risk and conduct \\nenhanced review when transactions involve companies with the potential \\nfor negative ESG impacts or vulnerabilities. At the highest level, we \\nbroadly examine legal, regulatory, environmental, social and governance \\nrisks, and review potential transactions through a risk management lens.\\nAt an operational level, in-house teams with strong technical expertise \\nguide environmental, health and safety (EHS) standards for our investing \\n activities. The teams also perform EHS due diligence on proposed \\ninvestment transactions, helping business teams identify and mitigate \\npotential risk factors. In these direct investments, we closely and \\ncontinually examine potential risks in our portfolio. This includes \\nmonitoring portfolio companies and engaging with their managers \\n as appropriate.In 2019, Goldman Sachs identi˜ed and managed EHS risks in a number \\nof potential transactions and portfolio companies, and in some cases, \\nforwent the transaction if risks were high and could not be mitigated. For \\nexample, when the ˜rm was completing the due diligence on a multi-\\nfamily property acquisition, our expanded due diligence scope identi˜ed \\nthat the on-site water supply well was being inadequately treated. After \\nadditional diligence into the causes and impacts of this water quality \\nconcern, we decided not to participate in the transaction.\\nIn another case, when considering the acquisition of an industrial \\nportfolio with a dozen facilities in Europe, we identi˜ed a number of \\nsigni˜cant de˜ciencies in EHS governance. Working with the Operational \\nRisk Management & Analysis Environmental Specialist Team, we required \\ndetailed EHS audits as a condition for the approval of the transaction. \\n As a result, detailed corrective action plans were developed for each \\nfacility to address the de˜ciencies, including additional staf˜ng and \\nenhanced authority of corporate EHS leadership, as well as development \\nof a ˜rmwide EHS governance process and improvements to localized \\nEHS procedures. \\n(continued from previous page)A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE\\n\\n45Managing Risks (continued)Appropriate oversight by our management and Board of \\nDirectors, as well as strong policies and practices, are key \\ncontributors to our ability to effectively manage a broad \\nspectrum of ˜nancial and non˜nancial risks across our \\nbusinesses, including with respect to ESG considerations.\\nOur Board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the \\nmanagement of the ˜rm™s most signi˜cant risks, placing signi˜cant \\nfocus on reputational risk and management™s operation of the ˜rm \\nresponsibly for the long term. The Board™s Public Responsibilities \\nCommittee (PRC) has primary oversight of our ˜rmwide approach to \\nsustainability and related risks, including through the review of key \\nESG policies. Our ESG policies and procedures provide transparency \\ninto our practices and are generally developed with the consultation \\nof stakeholders, including regulators and investors. Signi˜cantly, ESG and sustainability oversight is not limited to just the PRC, \\nbut also informs discussions with other committees and the full Board on topics ranging from climate risk to human capital \\nmanagement to the ˜rm™s broader sustainable ˜nance initiatives.\\nOversight of the ˜rm™s culture is an important element of how the Board engages on the ˜rm™s reputation, particularly \\nbecause our people are our greatest asset. Our Board holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining and \\ncommunicating the ˜rm™s culture throughout the ˜rm. Core to our success is that our focus on risk and reputation extends \\nthroughout every level of Goldman Sachs.\\nTo this end, our people are trained in our Business Standards and Principles, which were recently distilled into our Core Values, \\nand underscore the responsibility of every employee to uphold our culture of teamwork, excellence, personal initiative and \\naccountability. At the management level, our ˜rm™s committee structure serves to emphasize these points. Our committees are \\ngenerally composed of senior managers from our ˜rst and second lines of defense. These committees have speci˜c oversight \\nor decision-making responsibilities for various risk management activities. For example, while our Enterprise Risk Committee \\nis globally responsible for overseeing all of the ˜rm™s risks, both ˜nancial and non˜nancial, our Firmwide Reputational Risk \\nCommittee is responsible for vetting transactions that have the potential for heightened reputational risk.\\nRISK-CENTERED \\nGOVERNANCEOur culture has been a cornerstone of our business and performance throughout our 150-year history. Our 14 Business Principles, which \\n were codi˜ed in 1979, outline our commitment to our clients and our cultural expectations, including how teamwork, excellence, personal \\ninitiative and accountability are integral to our long-term success. These principles continue to guide us and were recently distilled into our \\nCore Values, which inform everything that we do.\\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines our shared responsibility to our clients, our colleagues and our communities. Goldman Sachs is committed to ensuring our culture of integrity remains a core value. \\nWe remain intensely focused on the impact that the conduct of our people can have on our ˜rm™s reputation. To further elevate and reinforce \\nthis focus, we have now created a Firmwide Conduct Committee, which is globally responsible for the oversight of conduct risk.\\nIn particular, the Firmwide Conduct Committee seeks to ensure that our frameworks and policies appropriately mitigate the risk that our \\npeople fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and Core Values, thereby falling short in ful˜lling their responsibilities \\n to the ˜rm, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community.\\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF OUR CULTURE \\n\\n46KEY METRICS AND INDICATORS\\nGoldman Sachs U.S. Workforce Demographics*\\nWhite\\nAsian\\nBlack or \\n African \\nAmerican\\nAmerican \\nIndian/\\n Alaskan \\n Native\\nHispanic or \\nLatinx\\nTwo or More \\nRaces\\nNative \\nHawaiian \\n  or Other \\nPaci˜c \\nIslander\\nFemales\\nExec/Sr. Of˜cials & Managers\\n77.3%14.5%2.7%0.1%4.4%1.0%0.0%23.4%Of˜cials & Managers\\n55.9%33.7%4.4%0.1%4.8%1.1%0.0%28.6%Professionals\\n53.1%28.7%5.8%0.1%9.8%2.3%0.2%39.6%All Others\\n57.5%8.2%15.9%0.1%15.4%2.5%0.4%59.9%Total\\n55.6%25.6%6.6%0.1%9.6%2.1%0.2%39.8%Source: Data anticipated to be ˜led in Goldman Sachs™ 2019 EEO-1 report. ﬁAll Othersﬂ is a combination of the following EEO-1 job categories: technicians, sales workers, administrative support, craft workers \\n(skilled), operatives (semi-skilled), laborers & helpers and service workers.

We also believe in the importance of \\nproviding greater transparency on our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities \\nacross our business and operations. \\nOur inaugural \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) Report\\n provides an \\noverview of our strategy and approach to climate-related risks and opportunities, including how the \\nmanagement and oversight of climate change is integrated across our global business. We also include \\nin this report the initial steps we have undertaken on climate risk scenario analysis to understand the \\nimpacts of both transition risk and physical risk. \\nWe recognize that climate change is highly complex and that it is inherently dif˜cult to project \\nhow related ˜nancial risks will materialize across the global economy and markets. In addition, \\nclimate scenario analysis is relatively new and evolving rapidly, including with respect to underlying \\nassumptions, methodologies and data. As such, this report represents the ˜rst step in our journey \\nwith the commitment to deepening our understanding of and advancing our approach to \\n climate-related risks and opportunities over time.\\nClimate-related opportunities and risks manifest in many different ways across our businesses. We see signi˜cant \\nopportunities across our ˜nancing, investing, asset management, advisory and risk management activities as we work with \\nour clients to help address the climate challenge. At the same time, extreme weather events may disrupt operations or \\naffect the value of our investments, negative ˜nancial impacts on clients from climate change may increase credit risk, and \\ninvolvement in certain industries associated with climate change may pose reputational risk. Given the broad-based impacts \\nof climate change, our cohesive strategy leverages the breadth of our global businesses and the depth of our expertise and \\ninsights to advance climate-related opportunities and to manage climate risk.\\nOur strategy includes a 10-year, $750 billion strategic target to ˜nance, invest and advise clients across nine sustainable \\ngrowth themes, which underlie climate transition and inclusive growth. In addition, given global economies for the \\nforeseeable future are dependent on fossil-based energy and carbon-intensive activities, we are committed to supporting \\nclients across all industries in their efforts to accelerate their climate transition and doing so in an orderly manner. This \\n enables us to not only better serve the interests of our clients but also more effectively manage our own risk exposures.\\nIn 2019, we strengthened our ˜rmwide efforts by establishing the Sustainable Finance Group (SFG), which reports to the \\nChairman™s Of˜ce and is responsible for partnering with our global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise \\nand drive innovative solutions for our clients. This effort is supported by a cross-divisional steering group of senior business \\nleaders to deliver the breadth of our capabilities. \\nOur strategy also entails understanding and managing climate-related physical, transition and reputational risks. This is \\nembedded both in our comprehensive ˜rmwide risk management approach and more speci˜cally in our climate change risk \\nmanagement framework. In addition to managing risk across our client activities and related balance sheet exposure and \\nreputational risk, we continue to adopt best practices to reduce our own carbon footprint and integrate resiliency into our \\nglobal operations. Underlying our strategy is an ongoing commitment to deepening our understanding and knowledge of, and progressing our \\napproach to, managing climate risks and advancing market opportunities. To that end, we leverage the lessons learned from \\nmanaging our own business and serving our clients, as well as from our external stakeholder engagement, to help inform the \\nwork we do and further best practices across the ˜nancial services industry and more broadly. We also harness our research insights \\nand thought leadership to help inform markets and policy, and engage in broader partnerships to further market solutions. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n59Governance Given climate-related impacts manifest across our businesses in different ways, oversight and management of climate \\nchange is integrated into our existing governance structure. This helps to ensure that climate change is strategically \\nmanaged and the expertise of the ˜rm is both integrated and leveraged across relevant committees and functions. \\nAt the most senior level, under the oversight of the Board of Directors and at the direction of senior management, we \\n are committed to serving our clients and delivering robust risk management, including on climate-related opportunities and \\nrisks. Our focus on not only clients but on effective risk and controls is core to our commitment to excellence, as re˚ected \\n in our Core Values, \\nBusiness Principles\\n, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.Board of Directors: \\nOur Board of Directors\\n (the ﬁBoardﬂ) and its committees are responsible for overseeing the management of the ˜rm™s \\nmost signi˜cant risks, placing signi˜cant focus on reputational risk and management™s operation of the ˜rm for the \\n long term.Ł  \\nThe Board™s \\nPublic Responsibilities Committee\\n (PRC) provides oversight of our ˜rmwide sustainability strategy and \\nsustainability issues affecting the ˜rm, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the PRC \\nreceives updates on the ˜rm™s Environmental Policy Framework (EPF), which serves as an ambitious roadmap for how \\nwe seek to leverage our people, capital and ideas to address critical environmental challenges and promote sustainable \\neconomic growth across our businesses. The EPF also includes environmental and social risk guidelines, including for \\ncarbon-intensive sectors. \\nŁ  \\nThe \\nRisk Committee\\n of the Board oversees the ˜rm™s overall risk-taking tolerance and management of ˜nancial and non-\\n˜nancial risks, including climate risk. In this respect, the Risk Committee provides oversight of the ˜rm™s Risk Appetite \\nStatement (RAS), which conveys the ˜rm™s view of its risk culture, risk appetite and risk management philosophies, \\nincluding those related to climate change.\\nTCFD Appendix\\n60Firmwide Committees: \\nIn addition to Board-level oversight, we have a series of ˜rm-level committees with risk management mandates that have \\noversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities and environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG) issues, including relevant climate change considerations. At a ˜rmwide level, the \\nEnterprise Risk Committee\\n oversees all of our ˜nancial and non-˜nancial risks, including climate-related risk. \\nIn addition, we have ˜rm-level risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions \\nand entities. For example, the \\nFirmwide Capital Committee\\n, which approves and oversees debt-related transactions, \\nincluding balance sheet-related commitments, integrates relevant climate-related considerations. For our own operations, \\nthe Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee\\n provides oversight over operational risk and resiliency, \\nincluding physical risks relating to climate change. \\nAll of our committees have responsibility for considering the reputational impact of transactions and activities that they \\nreview. The \\nFirmwide Reputational Risk Committee\\n provides oversight over transactions that may have heightened \\nreputational risk, which includes considerations relating to environmental and social factors, such as climate-related \\nreputational risk.\\nBelow are relevant key committees. \\nCommitteeDescriptionManagement CommitteeOversees global activities directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders.

As part of their \\nresponsibilities, the following three divisions/functions play a speci˜c role in managing climate-related risks and \\nopportunities and ensuring that we continue to advance our insights and expertise.\\nŁ  Risk Division: The Risk Division has a range of climate-related functions, working with business units and control \\ngroups on risk identi˜cation and stress-testing activities. The division also assesses ˜nancial risks of counterparties and \\ntransactions, including credit risk. In addition, the division oversees the ˜rm™s operational resilience framework, which \\nfactors in potential impacts from climate-related risks on the ˜rm™s activities.\\nŁ  Executive Of˜ce (EO) Š Sustainable Finance Group (SFG): \\nThe SFG, which reports to the Of˜ce of the Chairman, \\n is responsible for partnering with the ˜rm™s global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise and capabilities \\nto our clients and drive innovative market solutions that advance climate transition and inclusive growth. SFG also \\nengages with the ˜rm™s stakeholders to stay abreast of and, where relevant, help inform sustainable ˜nance and climate \\nchange-related policy. In addition, SFG works with the Business Intelligence Group, the Risk Division and the business \\nunits on ˜rmwide environmental and social risk management and related guidelines. By being part of the EO and \\nworking across all of the global businesses, clients and stakeholders, SFG brings together the breadth of our knowledge \\nand capabilities and ensures we continue to deliver our insights and expertise.\\nŁ  \\nServices Division Š Corporate Services & Real Estate (CSRE), Crisis Management Group:\\n The Services Division \\nprovides essential commercial advisory and management services to enable the ˜rm™s ˚ow of business, drive \\noperational ef˜ciency, manage risk and deliver the world™s best work experience and environment. CSRE partners \\n with the Crisis Management Group to assess and plan for near- and long-term climate-related risks across our operations \\nthrough infrastructure and business continuity reviews of the ˜rm™s global corporate real estate portfolio. This enables \\nclimate-related risk to be actively monitored and threats to be minimized to ensure the ˜rm operates continuously \\nthrough and swiftly recovers from any business disruption.\\nCross-Divisional Groups: \\nIn addition to the speci˜c divisions/functions, we have established cross-divisional steering groups to more effectively \\nleverage the ˜rm™s capabilities and activities and to ensure a holistic, ˜rmwide approach to managing climate-related risks \\nand opportunities. These include: \\nŁ  \\nSustainable Finance Steering Group:\\n Comprised of senior leaders responsible for integrating sustainability expertise \\nacross our divisions and bringing our capabilities together across the ˜rm. The group convenes periodically to guide \\nand support ˜rmwide sustainable ˜nance efforts relating to key strategic initiatives and client delivery, while providing \\nleadership for cross-divisional work streams and new opportunities.\\nŁ  Climate Change Risk Steering Group:\\n Comprised of representatives from the Risk Division, Services Division and the \\nExecutive Of˜ce that are responsible for evaluating climate-related scenario analysis and the broader TCFD assessment. \\nThis group also reviews the implementation of the strategic climate risk management approach outlined in this report to \\nstrengthen climate-related ˜nancial risk integration across our businesses and practices. TCFD Appendix\\n62Strategy Š Advancing the OpportunityAs markets and client activity shift in response to climate change, we have a substantial opportunity to harness innovative \\ncapital market tools and partner with our clients to help accelerate their climate transition. In addition, our ability to \\nleverage the breadth of our capabilities, our commitment to continuously deepening our expertise and re˜ning our insights, \\nand applying these both across our own operations and in serving our clients™ needs, ensures we stay front-footed in \\nintegrating climate change opportunities and risks.\\nIn December 2019, we announced a new \\nsustainable ˜nance target\\n of $750 billion of ˜nancing, investing and advisory \\nactivity by 2030. This target encompasses activities across nine strategic growth themes, which are rooted in 10+ years \\n of market research, focused on climate transition and inclusive growth. Areas of focus in our climate transition activity \\ninclude clean energy, sustainable transport, sustainable food and agriculture, waste and material, as well as ecosystem \\nservices Š areas where we can help scale technology and solutions through greater and more ef˜cient capital \\ndeployment. In addition to this target, we have expanded our work with clients more broadly to help them with their \\nclimate transition and in ensuring sustainable growth more broadly, and we are harnessing innovative market solutions \\n to help clients better manage and adapt to climate risks. \\nLeveraging the Breadth of Our Businesses We leverage our capabilities across ˜nancing, advisory, risk management solutions, asset management and investing \\nto help our clients achieve their climate-related goals, facilitate the low-carbon transition, and strengthen adaptation and \\nresiliency.

In addition, where appropriate, we advocate for \\neffective climate policy to help inform ways to advance market solutions that can help address climate change. \\n The following are examples. \\nŁ  Paris Climate Agreement:\\n We have actively engaged in making the business case for global climate action, including \\nsupport for the 2015 \\nUNFCCC Paris Agreement. We were one of the ˜rst US companies to commit to the \\nWhite House American Business Act on Climate Pledge in 2015\\n; we signed an \\nopen letter alongside 29 other CEOs\\n in 2017 to support \\nthe US staying in the Paris Agreement; and more recently, we were part of a \\ngroup of 80+ CEOs and labour leaders reiterating our support that staying in the Paris Agreement will strengthen US competitiveness in global markets.\\nŁ  Carbon pricing:\\n We have long articulated the need for governments to provide transparency around the costs of \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to create long-term value for GHG emissions reductions. More recently, in a \\nDecember 2019 \\neditorial, our CEO David Solomon underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and \\ncalled for governments to put a price on carbon. In February 2020, Goldman Sachs, alongside more than 25 companies, \\njoined as a founding member of the \\nClimate Leadership Council\\n (CLC) to support a revenue-neutral carbon fee and \\ndividend plan for the US.\\nŁ  \\nCatalyzing climate ˜nance:\\n We have continued to leverage our market insights to help catalyze greater capital ˚ows \\n to address climate change. In 2019, we joined the CEO-led \\nClimate Finance Leadership Initiative\\n (CFLI) as one of seven founding members, to support greater mobilization of climate ˜nance ˚ows. In September 2019, CFLI delivered \\nits Financing the Low-Carbon Future\\n report to the UN to inform ways to further mobilize private climate ˜nance at the \\nscale and speed needed to support a rapid and orderly transition to a low-carbon global economy.\\nŁ  \\nIntegrating climate-related risks and opportunities:\\n In 2019, Goldman Sachs Asset Management teamed up with a \\nselect group of other leading asset managers to advance climate-related investment among national sovereign wealth \\nfunds (SWFs). Known as the \\nOne Planet Asset Managers Initiative\\n, this collaboration supports the efforts of the One \\nPlanet SWF Working Group, composed of leading sovereign wealth funds, to drive a deeper consideration of the impact \\nof climate change on investment portfolios.\\nOperational Best PracticesIn addition to harnessing the breadth of our businesses to help our clients with their climate transition and scaling innovative market solutions to address climate change, Goldman Sachs is committed to being a leader in implementing \\nsustainability practices that minimize the impact of our global operations on the environment. For example, we have been \\ncarbon neutral from 2015 onward across our global direct Scope 1, indirect (market-based) Scope 2, and Scope 3 business \\ntravel emissions. Additionally, by year-end 2020, we are committed to procuring 100% renewable energy and attaining \\nLEED Gold or equivalent for 70 percent of our global corporate real estate footprint.\\nIn December 2019, we established a new suite of 2025 operational sustainability goals with a focus on strategic, \\ncollaborative partnerships that drive market transformation, as outlined in our \\nSustainability Report\\n. The ˜rm has been a \\nmember of RE100\\n since 2015 and recently joined additional initiatives \\nEV100\\n and EP100\\n with ambitious commitments  to electrify transport and deploy smarter energy use Š making us the ˜rst US company to become a member of all three \\n of The Climate Group\\n™s global corporate leadership initiatives to accelerate the clean energy transition. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n65Risk Management Because we are a global ˜nancial services ˜rm with clients operating in diverse sectors and of˜ces across many \\n countries, climate change presents a range of potential risk considerations across our businesses and activities. For \\nexample, climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary \\nlocations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients and also may adversely affect the \\nvalue of our investments. Climate change may also have a negative impact on the ˜nancial condition of our clients, which \\nmay decrease cash ˚ows from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures \\nto these clients. Additionally, our reputation may be impacted as a result of our involvement, or our clients™ involvement, \\n in certain industries or projects associated with climate change. \\nThe table below provides a description of the range of climate-related risk considerations. \\nRiskDescription MarketPhysical and transition risk could impact the value of assets in which we make markets and invest.CreditCounterparty ˜nancial performance and collateral values could deteriorate as the transition  and physical impacts of climate change manifest over time.LiquidityClimate-related disruptions could impact the availability and accessibility of capital in markets for certain sectors and securities.OperationalIncreased severity of climate-related events could impact our of˜ce locations and disrupt our  systems, people and processes across our global footprint.ReputationGrowing stakeholder focus on corporate action to meet emissions reduction targets can result  in increased reputational risk and reduced client and employee loyalty, investor divestment and \\n impacts to client activity. \\nLegalClimate-related disclosures are increasingly important and climate-related litigation could also result from stranded assets, acute climate events or resulting market price declines. TCFD Appendix\\n66Climate-Risk Scenario AnalysisOur overall business structure, strategy and comprehensive risk management provide a strong foundation for \\n managing and mitigating these potential risks. However, climate change is highly complex and non-linear, with many \\nuncertainties. In addition, new data, tools, and expectations are continuously evolving. As such, we have a climate \\n change risk management framework, which includes stress testing based on an initial set of scenarios. As part of \\n ongoing implementation, we are undertaking further re˜nement of the scenarios with the goal of improving their risk \\nmanagement bene˜t.\\nAs a global ˜nancial institution, we use a variety of stress-testing techniques to calculate the potential impact of a wide \\nrange of potential market moves. We perform stress testing on a regular basis to ensure a comprehensive analysis \\n of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks in anticipation of market events or conditions, which include climate \\nconsiderations. For climate stress testing, we perform both (i) transition risk stress tests on the value of our balance \\n sheet-related equity and credit assets, and (ii) physical risk stress tests on our global properties. The following is what \\n we have initially undertaken: \\n(i) Transition Risk Stress Test\\nTransition risk arises from changes to policy, technology and consumer preferences over time that reduce reliance on \\ncarbon-intensive products and services. The composition of industries, particularly in the energy sector, will change as \\na result of compliance with climate policy changes such as the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Since individual \\ncountries will implement decarbonization policies in different ways, changes to industries will also depend on where they \\nare located and how the policies evolve over time. Climate policy changes introduce ˜nancial risks to ˜nancial institutions \\nthat may own or ˜nance companies whose value could be affected. To measure these risks, we perform transition risk \\nstress testing.\\nCurrently, we perform transition risk stress tests under two scenarios: 1) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is fully \\nimplemented by all countries; and 2) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is partially implemented in line with current \\npolicy plans. In implementing each scenario, we assume that a credible policy change is announced and that the market \\nconsequently adjusts credit ratings and prices of affected companies and trades. In each stress test, we estimate the \\nchange in credit ratings that would result from each policy change as well as the changes in equity and credit prices that \\nare consistent with those credit rating changes. We then reprice all affected assets on our balance sheet to measure the \\ntotal change in value that would result under each scenario.\\n(ii) Physical Risk Stress Test\\nPhysical risk arises from changes to the environment that are produced directly by the continuing concentration of GHGs \\nin the atmosphere and the consequent increases in temperature, precipitation, sea level and other environmental factors. \\nPhysical changes in the environment may affect the value of properties directly; an increase in sea level, coupled with \\nmore extreme precipitation and hurricanes, would affect the value of coastal properties, for example. But physical risks \\nmay also in˚uence the value of assets indirectly by reducing local economic growth, worsening health or lowering labor \\nproductivity. The magnitude of physical risks that manifest is linked to transition scenarios, since GHG emissions and their \\nresulting impacts will be determined by policy-driven mitigation measures. \\nIn our physical stress test, we examine the effect of heat stress, water stress, extreme precipitation, sea level rise, and \\n˚ooding on our properties. The climate policy that we assume in our stress test is a high-emissions policy. We assume that \\nthe concentration of GHGs increases even more than expected under current policies and that therefore temperature and \\nother environmental risks worsen relative to business-as-usual expectations. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n67(iii) Next Steps\\nThese initial stress tests were helpful in understanding relative sensitivities and providing a starting point for further \\nre˜ning the analysis. To that end, we are working to enhance our transition risk and physical risk stress tests along a \\nnumber of dimensions in order to improve their decision usefulness. In our transition risk stress test, we are examining \\nhow to increase its ˚exibility so that we can run a wider range of scenarios that incorporate more varied policy changes. \\nSimilarly, in our physical risk stress tests, we are exploring how we might incorporate a wider range of policy changes, \\nsuch as full adherence to the Paris Agreement. We are also considering how to add more physical risks to our physical \\nstress test, such as wild˜res, and how to better estimate the effects of physical risks on asset values. More broadly, we \\nare investigating whether the transition risk and physical risk stress tests should be uni˜ed or whether it would be more \\nbene˜cial to keep them separate. \\nComprehensive Risk Management Approach Business Structure and Strategy: \\nAs a global ˜nancial institution with a diverse set of businesses and clients, our business structure and strategy help us \\nmanage overall climate-related risks and increase our ability to participate in climate-related opportunities. \\nŁ  \\nA signi˜cant part of our client ˜nancings in our Investment Banking\\n business are provided through our underwritten \\nofferings where we connect users of capital with investors versus holding ˜nancings on our balance sheet. For \\nunderwritings, how we perform due diligence, make business selection decisions and provide relevant disclosures \\n are critical and form part of our comprehensive risk management approach.\\nŁ  \\nOur Asset Management\\n and Consumer & Wealth Management\\n businesses largely relate to client assets and are integrating ESG considerations, including climate-related strategies for our clients, as well as taking into account factors \\nthat could be material in valuing performance and risk, such as those relating to climate change.\\nŁ  \\nOur Global Markets\\n business is highly diversi˜ed and managed in a way that re˚ects real-time information and shifts \\n in potential risks. Given this current business mix and structure, and based on our initial stress tests, the direct balance sheet impacts \\nfrom climate change are relatively modest. However, our ability to effectively manage climate risks and opportunities is \\nimportant across our businesses in serving our clients and managing and protecting existing pools of assets while \\n creating opportunities for further growth.\\nBusiness Activities: \\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have a well-established enterprise \\nrisk management (ERM) framework, which is ultimately overseen by our Board. The ERM framework employs a \\ncomprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and it is designed to enable robust risk management processes \\nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our business activities. \\nAs part of our risk management approach, we have ˜rmwide policy guidelines and dedicated teams that support business \\nselection and review processes:\\nTCFD Appendix\\n68Ł  \\nFirmwide policy guidelines\\n for carbon-intensive sectors and activities, such as coal-˜red power generation, palm \\n oil, and oil & gas are included in our Environmental Policy Framework\\n (EPF). The EPF was updated in December \\n 2019 to restrict certain carbon-related business activities and to strengthen our work with clients to help them with \\n their climate transition. Ł  \\nUpfront business selection and due diligence processes\\n that include 14 key sector and cross-sector \\nguidelines, and worst-case-loss calculations for physical commodities in certain carbon-intensive sectors, complement the EPF. These \\nguidelines and tools are leveraged across the various activities of the ˜rm at the business selection stage and through \\ndesignated committee review processes. There are escalation mechanisms and protocols undertaken at each stage. \\nWhere relevant, we also incorporate extreme weather and ˚ooding event probability into worst-case-loss calculations \\n for certain transactions. See \\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\\n for more information. \\nŁ  \\nRisk Identi˜cation and Scenario Design\\n, which is a periodic process that we undertake to review the materiality of \\nevolving risks in our business activities over a two-year forward-looking horizon, includes the assessment of impact from \\nclimate change.\\nIn addition, our ongoing risk monitoring from credit, liquidity, and market risk management teams, mark-to-market portfolio \\nvaluations, dynamic hedging, and insurance requirements where relevant, enables overall position management and \\nexposure reduction where potential material risks are identi˜ed.\\nOperations: \\nFor our physical assets, the Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee oversees business continuity planning \\nand crisis management efforts, including planning for climate-related risks. The committee oversees efforts related to:\\nŁ  \\nRegular resiliency reviews \\nŁ  \\nComprehensive infrastructure and business continuity assessments \\nŁ Overall real estate site selection and management strategy\\nŁ  \\nBusiness Continuity Planning and remote access infrastructure\\nWe also consider such risks through all stages of our corporate real estate strategy, from site selection and building design \\nto occupancy and facilities management. Within our operations, we utilize various metrics and dashboards to prioritize and \\ntrack risks that pose a threat to the health and safety of our employees or to the ˜rm™s critical infrastructure assets that \\nsupport core business functions.TCFD Appendix\\n69Metrics and Targets\\nBusiness Opportunities:\\n The ˜rm has had a long-standing commitment to harnessing market solutions to address climate \\nchange. One of the key ways we have been doing this is by mobilizing capital to scale clean energy, given energy is the \\nlargest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Clean energy also brings bene˜ts of energy diversi˜cation and security, \\ntechnology innovation, and green jobs, as well as health bene˜ts. Since 2006, we have mobilized over $115 billion in clean \\nenergy ˜nancing and investments.\\nGoing forward, we have a more expansive goal to deploy $750 billion in sustainable ˜nance over the next 10 years, with \\n a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth. Please refer to our \\nSustainability Report\\n for more information about our \\nSustainable Finance Goals.\\nOperations and GHG Emissions:\\n To ensure we remain a leader in implementing sustainability practices and reducing \\noperational risk, our Services Division is committed to minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment and \\nadopting best practices. We have been carbon neutral across our global operations and business travel since 2015, and \\nare progressing on our 2020 operational goals. Additionally, alongside the sustainable ˜nance target, we announced new \\noperational goals for 2025, with a focus on strategic, collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation.\\n See Our Operational Impact.We currently measure, disclose and reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our own activities, and also \\n disclose Scope 3 emissions related to business travel. See \\npage 47 for our latest GHG emissions and energy use data \\n for 2019. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n70The Path Forward This report is the ˜rst step in our application of TCFD recommendations. Goldman Sachs is committed to continuing \\nour work with various stakeholders, including clients, shareholders, peer banks and other key constituents to improve \\nmethodologies on climate-related risk analysis and disclosures and to furthering climate-related opportunities to \\nfacilitate the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy. Per the TCFD recommendations, which acknowledge that \\nimplementation is a journey that will evolve over time, we will continue to re˜ne our climate initiatives and disclosure in a \\nway that progresses our ability to more effectively manage risk-and-capture strategic growth opportunities while helping \\nto inform the broader market. We look forward to continuing our engagement on this important topic, and leveraging the \\nbreadth of our businesses to navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nThis document is not a product of Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.

We have improved the way \\n we listen to customers and acted on that feedback, \\nand we have simpli˜ed our governance structures \\nto create clearer and stronger lines of authority. \\n We have also accelerated our support for the \\nlow-carbon transition.\\nYet for all our strides, there are areas where we can \\nand must do better. Our senior leadership teams \\nare still not diverse enough. Many of our customers \\nstill ˜nd it too di˛cult to bank with us. On conduct, \\nwe have more to do in adapting to changing \\nsocietal expectations. \\nAddressing these aspects of our performance \\n will take time. There are no quick or easy ˜xes. \\n But where there is work to be done, we will do \\n so with urgency, conviction and clear purpose. \\nAs Group Chief Executive, my overriding priority \\n is to create stronger relationships with all our \\nstakeholders Œ and it is part of our ambition to \\ncreate what we call the healthiest human system \\n in our industry. If we can do that, and live up to \\n our wider societal obligations, then we believe \\n we will materially improve all aspects of HSBC™s \\nperformance and safeguard the future of the \\norganisation for generations to come. \\nAll of you reading this are part of that ambition. \\nYour feedback and your views are important to \\n us. We will continue to take them into account, \\n and to listen, learn and act. \\nI hope you ˜nd the report useful. \\n John Flint\\nGroup Chief Executive\\nLiving up to our wider societal obligations \\n has always been part of HSBC™s culture and \\nidentity. Our success over 154 years has been \\nfounded on our ability to build strong and trusted \\nrelationships not just with our customers, but \\n with the communities and other stakeholders \\n we serve all over the world. \\nWe recognise that there have been times, \\nparticularly in the recent past, where we have \\nfailed to meet the standards expected of us.\\nSocietal expectations are changing, and investors \\nare placing increasing importance on the wider \\nimpact businesses have on people and the planet. \\nSo over the past few years we have taken steps \\n to improve all aspects of our non-˜nancial \\nperformance, and to live up to the duty of \\n care we have to all our stakeholders today. \\nThis \\nESG Update\\n Œ the fourth we have produced \\nŒ shines a light on our progress. It covers all the \\nusual areas, from corporate governance and our \\nenvironmental impact, to customer satisfaction \\n and our approach to conduct. We are continuing \\n to meet our reporting obligations under the terms \\nof the UN Global Compact and renewing our \\ncommitment to the Compact™s principles.\\nﬁ \\nOur success over 154 years has been \\n founded on our ability to build strong \\n and trusted relationships.ﬂ\\n2Overview\\n\\n˜˚˛˛˝˙ˆˇ˘ˆ˘˛ˆˆ˚˘ˆˆˆ˘˛˚ˆ˘˚˘˜˚˙˚˘˛˝˚˘˚˙˚˘˙˚˙ˆ˚ˆˆˇ˙ˇ˚ˆˆ˚˘˛˝˚˜˘˚˝˘˛ˆ˘˜˚†“ˆ“˜˘˚‘\\n\\nHSBC at a glance\\nOur global reach\\nOur global businesses\\nAbout HSBC\\nHSBC is one of the world™s largest banking and ˜nancial services organisations.

These human \\nconnections are complex \\n and overlap. Many of our \\nemployees are customers \\n and shareholders, while our \\nbusiness customers are often \\nsuppliers. We exist to serve, \\ncreating value for our \\ncustomers and shareholders. \\nOur size and global reach \\nmean our actions can have \\n a signi˜cant impact, which \\n is why we want to create \\n the healthiest human system \\nin ˜nancial services to help \\nenable our business strategy.\\nWe listen to our stakeholders in a number of di˝erent ways, \\nfrom employee and customer surveys to client meetings. \\nInvestors tell us what matters to them in the annual ESG \\ninvestor survey and in qualitative assessments during investor \\nmeetings. We are also informed by stock exchange listing \\n and disclosure rules in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.\\nWe use this information to identify what issues are material \\n to our stakeholders, taking into account the nature of our \\nbusiness. In line with the provisions of the ESG Guide, \\n an issue is considered to be material when management \\ndetermines that it has become su˛ciently important to \\n our stakeholders that it should be publicly reported.\\nManagement tables material issues for discussion at the \\n ESG Steering Committee and other relevant governance \\nforums. We use these themes and concerns as a guide \\n for our \\nESG Update\\n. Further information about the ESG \\nSteering Committee is included in the ‚Ensuring strong \\ncorporate governance™ section of the report on page 40. \\nWe acknowledge that material issues evolve over time, \\n and we will continue to assess them to ensure we remain \\ncurrent in our approach and communications. \\n5\\nOur approach \\nReporting on material issues in an open \\n and transparent way is key to meeting \\n the expectations of our stakeholders. \\nOur ESG approach\\n ŒWe support the global transition to the \\nlow-carbon economy through our own \\nsustainable operations and by supporting \\nour customers with their transition.\\n ŒWe maintain robust climate-related risk \\nmanagement, covering sensitive sectors, \\nsuch as energy, palm oil and forestry.\\n ŒWe aim to maintain high standards \\n of governance across all geographies.\\n ŒWe are committed to protecting our \\ncustomers and communities through \\n˜nancial crime risk management and \\ncybersecurity due diligence.\\nEnvironmental\\nSocial\\nGovernance\\nExamples:\\n ŒIn our ambition to provide $100bn of sustainable ˜nancing, \\nfacilitation and investment by 2025, we have delivered \\n a cumulative total of $28.5bn since 2017, with external \\nassurance of this number provided by PwC using ISAE \\n3000. The full assurance statement is included on page 28.\\n ŒWe are a signatory to the Financial Stability Board \\n Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. \\n The second year disclosure is available on page 30.\\nExamples:\\n ŒDuring 2018, we concentrated on the completion of the \\n ˜nal elements of our Global Standards programme, which \\n is designed to ensure the management of ˜nancial crime \\ncompliance is embedded in our day-to-day management \\n and governance.\\n ŒWe are committed to applying both the letter and spirit \\n of the law in all the territories in which we operate.\\nExamples:\\n ŒIn this report, we publish customer information for each of \\nour global businesses, including spotlights on conduct. This \\nincludes information on the strengthening of our controls, \\nand achieving fair outcomes for customers and culture.\\n ŒOur employee surveys give us invaluable insight into our \\npeople. Results in 2018 show that 74% feel able to speak \\n up when they see behaviour that they consider to be wrong.\\n ŒWe are building a diverse workforce and have set a target \\n of 30% women holding senior leadership roles by 2020. \\nCurrently 28% of our senior leaders are women, so while \\n we are making progress we recognise there is still room \\n for improvement.\\nOur conduct approach\\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility for good conduct \\nthrough the delivery of fair outcomes for customers and \\nbehaving in a way that protects ˜nancial markets integrity. \\n We have therefore implemented a conduct framework \\ndescribing the outcomes that must be delivered across the \\nGroup and which in turn form a key component of our risk \\nmanagement framework. This means that our decisions should \\nconsider the impact on customers and markets. In addition, \\ndelivery of the required Group values and conduct behaviours \\ncontinues to be considered in performance management \\n for our people across the Group. Our conduct is overseen \\n by senior risk and executive committees within each of our \\nbusinesses, functions and HSBC Operations Services and \\nTechnology. The Board maintains oversight of conduct \\n matters through the Group Risk Committee. \\n ŒWe aim to grow in a way that puts the \\ncustomer at the centre.\\n ŒWe want to create the healthiest human \\nsystem in our industry. We are working to \\ncreate the right environment so everyone \\ncan ful˜l their potential.\\n ŒWe are focusing on diversity and inclusion \\nin our workforce, and we are striving to \\nput the customer at the heart of everything \\nwe do.\\n6Overview\\n\\n Customers\\nWe aim to grow in a way that puts the \\n customer at the centre by improving \\n performance with digital enhancements \\n while maintaining ˜nancial crime standards. \\nAt a glance\\nOur relationship\\nOur purpose is to be where the growth is, connecting \\ncustomers to opportunities. We help enable businesses \\n to thrive and economies to prosper, helping people ful˜l \\n their hopes and dreams and realise their ambitions. \\nWe create value by providing the products and services \\n our customers need, and aim to do so in a way that ˜ts \\nseamlessly into their lives. This helps us to build long-lasting \\nrelationships with our customers. We maintain trust by \\nstriving to protect our customers™ data and information, \\n and delivering fair outcomes for them Œ and if things \\n go wrong, we need to address complaints in a timely \\nmanner. Operating with high standards of conduct is \\n central to our long-term success and underpins our \\n ability to serve our customers.\\nIn this section we report on our customers as four \\n distinct groups: our retail customers˙ medium and large-\\nsized corporate customers˙ global and institutional \\ncustomers˙ and high net worth customers. These groups \\n  are serviced by our four global businesses respectively: \\nRetail Banking and \\nWealth Management \\n(‚RBWM™)\\nCommercial Banking \\n(‚CMB™)\\nGlobal Banking and \\nMarkets (‚GB&M™)\\nGlobal Private \\n Banking (‚GPB™)\\nWe help 38 million customers \\nacross the world to manage \\ntheir ˜nances, buy their \\nhomes, and save and invest \\n for the future.\\nOur HSBC Premier and \\nAdvance propositions are \\naimed at mass aˆuent and \\nemerging aˆuent customers \\nwho value international \\nconnectivity. For customers \\nwith simpler banking needs, \\nwe o˝er a full range of \\nproducts and services \\nre˚ecting local requirements. \\nWe support approximately \\n 1.5 million business customers \\nin 53 countries and territories, \\nranging from small enterprises \\nfocused primarily on their \\ndomestic markets, through \\n to large companies \\n operating globally.\\nOur services include working \\ncapital, term loans, payment \\nservices and international \\ntrade facilitation, as well as \\nexpertise in mergers and \\nacquisitions, and access \\n to ˜nancial markets.\\nWe serve approximately \\n 4,100 clients in more than 50 \\ncountries and territories.

We also launched our Universal \\nBanker programme in ˜ve markets, \\n which helps train our people to be digitally \\nequipped, and empowers them to resolve \\nmore queries themselves. Over 4,000 \\nemployees are now Universal Bankers. \\n Less positively, the satisfaction score of \\n our US contact centres fell and overall \\ncomplaints rose, driven by a signi˜cant \\noverhaul of the banking platform, which \\nled to increased call volumes and customer \\nwait times. We addressed this through \\nincreasing headcount and expanding our \\nchatbot capabilities.\\nWe listen to our customers in a number \\n of di˝erent ways, including through our \\ninteractions with them, surveys, social \\nmedia and from their complaints. We use \\nthese insights to improve our services. ˇ\\nCustomer recommendation \\nIn 2018, we surveyed more than two million \\ncustomers on their likelihood to recommend \\nHSBC to others and their satisfaction \\n with our services. We have made some \\nprogress, with recommendation scores \\nimproving in the majority of markets. More \\ncustomers recommended us for being \\neasily accessible, o˝ering good digital \\nservices,ˇand our overall customer service. \\nHowever, our savings accounts remain an \\narea of dissatisfaction, with more customers \\ntelling us they are seeking competitive rates \\nand charges. In the UK, the First Direct \\nbrand ranked ˜rst for mobile banking \\nservices and second overall in the \\nCompetition and Markets Authority \\nrankings in 2018, where banks were scored \\nby customers on the quality of service.\\nIn 2018, we changed the way we \\n report customer recommendation by \\nbroadening the range of customers we \\nsurvey, and by looking at the full range of \\nscores provided. We believe this provides \\n a more representative and complete \\nperspective on the customer service \\n we o˝er relative to the market. \\nCustomer satisfaction \\nCustomer satisfaction in our online banking \\nservices rose in some of our key markets in \\n2018, following signi˜cant declines in the \\nprevious year. The decline in satisfaction in \\n2017 came after the launch of a new online \\nbanking system and enhanced security \\nfeatures. The new platform should help \\nenable us to roll out new digital services at \\na faster pace while keeping our customers \\nsafe. However, we saw a drop in customer \\nsatisfaction as customers learned how to \\nuse the new service. By listening to our \\ncustomers, we improved the way we \\ncommunicated changes and ˜xed a \\nnumber of the issues that were causing \\n the most frustration, such as login and \\npayments.

We have responded with new \\ninitiatives to improve the experience such \\nas adding real-time customer assistance \\ncapabilities, and plan to continue \\nenhancements to our capabilities. In 2018, \\nwe focused our e˝orts on upgrading our \\nmobile banking experience where we have \\nseen the highest growth in customer \\nusage.

Apple™s Touch ID is now live in 18 markets and HSBC Voice ID \\n is in ˜ve markets. Last year, 80% of customer transactions were conducted via mobile or online channels. More than 30% \\n of loans, cards and deposits sales were through digital channels.\\nIn the UK, we trained our front-line people to become more digitally pro˜cient. In branch or on the phone, they can show \\ncustomers how to complete tasks digitally. Last year, 85% of new customers opened accounts through a supported \\n digital experience.\\nMaking our \\n processes easier\\nIn the UK, we are simplifying our mortgage process. Applications can be approved within 10 days with the help of \\nautomatic valuations, improved credit policies and increased underwriter availability.\\nTo make investing more accessible, we equipped our branch employees in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore \\nwith mobile tablets, and launched an online ˜nancial health check. Customers can now understand their investment \\noptions in their own time, without a specialist appointment. For more information on our digital enhancements, please \\n see ‚Our investment in technology™ on page 18.\\nMaking it easy to \\nunderstand us and \\n our fees and charges\\nIn Singapore, we simpli˜ed our mortgage application forms and o˝er letters, so customers can be clear about their \\nrepayment schedule, terms and conditions, and fees and charges. \\nThrough digital messaging we are raising customer awareness around overdrafts in the UK, Hong Kong, France and the \\n US. In the UK, we expanded the volume of overdraft alerts, which we ˜rst introduced in 2017, sending more than 26 million \\nalerts in 2018 to help customers save money. Over half (56%) of customers who receive an alert pay in funds to avoid \\ncharges. To help even more customers avoid fees, we are introducing services like our Connected Money app, which \\n helps people keep track of their spending (see page 11).\\nWhen things go wrong\\nWe aim to ensure customers™ complaints \\nare recorded so we can understand what \\nwent wrong and why, and then act upon \\nthe feedback. Complaints are monitored \\nand reported to governance forums. \\nSenior executives are measured against \\ncomplaint-handling performance. \\nThe way we handle complaints and how \\nfast we respond is important to us and our \\ncustomers. In 2018, we resolved 77% of \\ncomplaints on the same or next working \\nday, and 86% within ˜ve working days, \\nexcluding UK complaints related to \\npayment protection insurance (‚PPI™). \\n The most common complaints related to \\nprocess and procedures (39%), service \\n(25%), and fees and charges (9%).\\nIn 2018, we received approximately 1.2 \\nmillion complaints from retail customers \\n in our large markets referenced in the \\nadjacent table, a 16% increase compared \\nwith 2017, primarily driven by the UK and \\nMexico. The increase in UK complaints \\nmainly related to PPI, which is consistent \\nacross the UK industry, and to digital \\nregistration issues. An improvement \\nprogramme for non-PPI complaints was \\nintroduced in 2018, resulting in complaint \\nvolumes declining in the fourth quarter. Our \\nbusiness in Mexico experienced an increase \\nin complaints due to the prevalence of \\nonline fraud transactions leading to service \\ninterruption. We provided refunds to the \\ncustomers and strengthened our fraud \\ncontrol measures, as well as launching a \\ncard control app that allows customers to \\nmanage deactivating controls on online \\ncard usage. As of September 2018, the \\nFinancial Services Consumers Protection \\nBureau in Mexico ranked HSBC as the best \\nbank among the seven largest banks for \\ncomplaint resolution and quality of service \\non their Customer Care Performance Index. \\nComplaints at our UAE business fell 18%, \\nbut remained relatively high. Complaints \\nwere primarily due to manual processes, \\nservice delays, sta˝ knowledge and clarity \\nof our communication to customers. These \\ncontinue to be addressed through a \\ncustomer experience programme.\\n1. \\n  \\nA complaint is de˜ned as ‚any expression \\n of dissatisfaction, whether upheld or not, from \\n (or on behalf of) a former, existing or prospective \\ncustomer relating to the provision of, or failure to \\nprovide, a speci˜c product or service activity™.\\nRBWM complaint volumes\\nComplaints per 1,000 \\ncustomers per month\\n12018\\n2017\\nUK4.0\\n3.3\\nHong Kong\\n0.5 \\n 0.7\\nFrance\\n4.7\\n6.0\\nUS3.9\\n3.4\\nCanada\\n3.1\\n2.7\\nMexico\\n5.3\\n4.5\\nSingapore\\n1.4\\n1.6\\nMalaysia\\n0.4\\n0.5\\nMainland China\\n0.7\\n0.7\\nUAE\\n5.6\\n6.8\\n9Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nWe recognise we have a responsibility \\n to deliver fair outcomes for our retail \\ncustomers and behave in a way that \\nprotects ˜nancial market integrity. We \\nmanage this through a range of activities, \\nfrom working to ensure products are \\ndesigned fairly to endeavouring to \\n meet customers™ ˜nancial needs. \\nWe have put in place clear policies, \\nframeworks and governance to protect \\n our customers. Our conduct and risk \\nframeworks describe the outcomes that \\nmust be delivered across the Group. In \\nperformance management, we consider \\nwhether behaviour is in line with our \\nvalues. Conduct is overseen by senior risk \\nand executive committees, while the Board \\nmaintains oversight of conduct matters \\nthrough the Group Risk Committee. \\nProduct design and fair value \\nGood product design helps provide the \\nright outcomes for our customers. We \\nprovide training through the Product \\nManagement Academy. To date, more \\nthan 1,000 of our people have completed \\ntraining on topics including customer \\ninsight, customer-focused design, \\n making communications simple, product \\ndevelopment, management oversight \\n and governance. \\nCustomer insight is the foundation of \\n the design process, so we work with \\ncustomer research groups to co-create \\nsolutions. This involves checking in \\n with customer panels and user labs \\nthroughout the process to understand \\ncustomer reaction, so we can dynamically \\nadapt designs to meet changing needs. \\nIn Mexico, we launched our Stilo \\n banking service, which includes a money \\nmanagement tips app, ˜lling a gap in \\nservice that our customers had told us \\nabout. In Hong Kong, we worked with \\nmore than 3,000 customers to design \\n and test our PayMe services and features \\nbefore launching them, including peer-to-\\npeer payments for customers and \\nnon-customers. PayMe reached a \\nmilestone of approximately 1.5 million \\nusers in 2018. \\nThe range of products o˝ered in our \\nmarkets is managed globally. Any newly \\ndeveloped product goes through a \\nreview process with global oversight for \\ndi˝erent or complex products. During \\nthis process, products are tested to help \\nensure they are suitable and o˝er fair \\nvalue to customers.\\nOngoing monitoring is also a critical \\ncomponent of our product governance \\nprogramme. Regular in-depth reviews \\nrecognise a product or service may \\nbecome unsuitable over a period of time, \\nwhether it is after a signi˜cant event \\n or following an accumulation of \\n multiple changes.\\nProduct design key principles:\\nOur products should remain relevant \\n in each country they are o˝ered.\\nWe o˝er a consistent, simple and \\ncarefully selected range of products.\\nWe act on feedback from customers \\n to provide better and more accessible \\nproducts/services. \\nProducts that no longer meet our \\n high standards or customer needs \\n are withdrawn from sale.\\nWe also conduct regular product reviews \\nand fair value assessments in each of the \\nmarkets we operate in, to help ensure we \\ndeliver fair value.\\nPricing key principles:\\nAll products and services must meet \\n a minimum set of design standards.\\nWe carry out regular comparisons \\n of HSBC pricing with those of local \\ncompetitors and with our own fair \\n value standards, considering the total \\ncharges and features of a product.\\nWe review the usage levels of product \\nfeatures to assess if customers™ \\nbehaviours and responses demonstrate \\nthey are receiving value.\\nOversight and governance of our \\n fair value assessments and product \\nsafety is provided by the Global Wealth \\nManagement Oversight Committee, \\nchaired by the Global Head of Wealth \\nProducts, and the Retail Banking \\nManagement Committee, chaired \\n by the Global Head of Retail Products. \\nThe RBWM Global Incentive Committee, \\nwhich reports to the Chief Executive \\nO˛cer of RBWM, oversees front-line \\nemployee incentives.\\nMeeting our customers™ needs\\nIn order to meet customers™ needs \\ne˝ectively, we have robust oversight of \\nthe sales process, including reviewing \\nthe suitability of the products we o˝er, \\nsales quality monitoring, and how we \\nincentivise our sta˝.\\nWe consider our customers™ ˜nancial \\nneeds and personal circumstances to \\nassist us in o˝ering suitable product \\nrecommendations. This is achieved \\nthrough: \\n Œa globally consistent methodology \\n to rate the riskiness of investment \\nproducts, which is customised for \\n local regulatory requirements˙\\n Œa robust customer risk pro˜ling \\nmethodology to help assess \\ncustomers™ ˜nancial objectives, \\nattitude towards risk, ˜nancial ability \\n to bear investment risk and their \\nknowledge and experience˙\\n Œgoal projection tools and calculators \\n to help customers plan for their future \\nin line with their overall investment \\nobjectives˙ and \\n Œconsistent global advisory standards to \\nfollow when we make recommendations \\nto our customers, while taking into \\naccount local regulations.\\nFrom a service perspective, our goal\\n is to empower our people to resolve \\nissues. In the UK, we embedded a \\nprogramme to give front-line employees \\na means to raise and contribute towards \\nsolving customer issues and to escalate \\nSpotlight: Conduct\\n10Customers | \\nOur\\n Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nlarger issues to executive management. \\nSince introducing the programme in \\n late 2017, over 8,000 issues have been \\nraised, and in 2018 more than 6,500 \\n were resolved.ˇ \\nSales quality\\nTo assure the quality of our sales process \\nand employees™ behaviour in each of our \\nmarkets, we either conduct a mystery \\nshopping programme or a sales quality \\nprogramme, or both.ˇIssues identi˜ed are \\ntreated seriously. Action is taken to help \\nachieve a fair outcome for customers.\\nWhere concerns are found, we will \\ncontact the customer to explain and \\nremediate. Depending on the severity \\n of the issue, the relevant employee will \\nbe given enhanced training to improve \\ntheir behaviour and they may become \\nineligible for an incentive reward \\npayment.ˇWhere a case of misconduct \\noccurs, disciplinary action may be \\n taken, which can lead to dismissal.ˇˇ \\nFront-line employee incentives\\nIn 2013, we changed our front-line \\nincentives to create a discretionary \\nframework rather than a straight formula \\nbetween sales and reward. Our people \\nare now recognised for demonstrating \\nour values and behaviours as well as \\nmeeting customers™ needs through \\nproducts and services. The framework \\nexists to recognise our front-line \\nemployees who go above and beyond \\n for the customer, to deliver fair outcomes \\nand support the sustainable growth of \\nour business.\\nAligned to our customer experience \\nstandards, the incentive framework \\nassesses how our people listen to our \\ncustomers to understand their needs \\n so that they can provide appropriate \\nsolutions. Should an individual \\ndemonstrate behaviours that do not \\n align with our core values, there is a \\ndisciplinary process that again can \\n a˝ect reward payments.\\nBuilding ˜nancial capability \\nDelivering fair outcomes for customers \\nalso involves providing tools and content \\nthat help customers have the con˜dence \\nand competence to make the most of \\ntheir money. In 2018, we made public \\ncommitments around building ˜nancial \\ncapability, and we took a number of \\nactions to deliver on these commitments:\\n ŒIn the UK, we launched the HSBC \\nConnected Money app, which helps \\nusers see all their banking relationships \\nin one place and keep track of how \\n they spend their money. It has been \\ndownloaded 240,000 times. One \\n recent new feature allows users to \\n keep track of savings goals using \\n virtual savings pots.\\n ŒWe introduced card control features \\n in the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico, \\n so customers can control their \\n card spending and receive real-time \\nalerts on their activity. In Mexico, \\ncustomers can set spending limits \\n and block spending categories, \\n such as online shopping and \\nentertainment, including gambling.\\n \\nFor further details on how we support \\n building ˜nancial capability and inclusion, \\n see pages 34 and 44.\\nManaging fraud\\nFraudulent activities are a risk and \\n a concern for our customers. We \\n are committed to mitigating and \\nreducing their impact through a \\n range of actions, including new fraud \\nprevention systems, improvements to \\nour internal processes and procedures, \\nas well as communications to raise \\nawareness. We introduced an automated \\ncustomer contact solution, which uses \\ntwo-way SMS messaging, in the second \\nhalf of 2018. Since its introduction, \\naround 4,000 customers per day are \\n able to respond instantly to our fraud \\nenquiries to either unblock their card \\n or report fraud. Approximately half of \\n all card fraud-related queries are now \\nresolved without the need of a phone \\nconversation, which has saved \\ncustomers approximately 87,000 calls \\nevery month. We plan to introduce this \\n service to more of our customers \\nthroughout 2019.\\nOperational resilience \\nHSBC invests in the reliability and \\nresilience of our systems to help prevent \\ndisruption to customers. During 2018, \\n we continued to upgrade our IT systems, \\nsimplifying our service provision and \\nreplacing older IT infrastructure and \\napplications. These enhancements led \\n to continued global improvements in \\nservice availability during the year for \\nboth our customers and employees.\\n \\nFor further details on how we aim to maintain \\nand continually improve our operational \\nresilience capability, see page 19.\\nSpotlight: Conduct \\ncontinued\\n11Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nOur Commercial Banking\\n customers \\nHow we listen to our customers\\nActing on feedback\\nWe are committed to improving customer \\nsatisfaction for all our business customers, \\nfrom start-ups to large corporates.\\nWe have introduced additional governance \\nto embed a customer-led approach into \\nour decision making. In 2018, we created \\nthe new role of Global Head of Customer \\nExperience, and appointed customer \\nchampions in key business areas. \\nNew tools have been introduced to help \\nus understand our customers. These \\ninclude customer journey mapping, which \\naims to take a holistic approach to assess \\ncustomers™ current experiences and \\ndesign ideal ones. More than 350 of our \\npeople globally have been trained in its \\nuse. New arti˜cial intelligence (‚AI™) tools \\nused by our insight and analytics teams \\nalso allow us to scrutinise more open-\\nended feedback from customers quickly \\nand accurately.\\nCustomer satisfaction\\nWe use syndicated research, feedback \\nfrom social media, and operational data \\nto help us identify what areas are most \\nimportant to our customers, and where \\nour performance could be improved. \\nAreas of focus include the ease and \\nspeed of the account opening process, \\nour e˛ciency in dealing with queries \\n and our range of products. \\nWe still have some way to go to achieve \\nour ambitions, but our rank position against \\ncompetitors for customer satisfaction either \\nremained ˚at or improved compared with \\nlast year in seven of our eight key markets.\\n1Moments of Truth\\nIn 2018, we fully embedded our Moments \\nof Truth programme, surveys which allow \\nus to continually capture feedback from \\ncustomers about interactions we know are \\nimportant to them. We have surveyed over \\n18,000 customers across 40 markets and \\nhave driven improvements through more \\nthan 100 actions taken to address the \\nfeedback. Key performance metrics across \\nall these key events, such as opening \\n an account, calling our contact centres, \\nsetting up internet banking, applying for \\ncredit or changing relationship manager, \\nhave improved in 2018. We actively \\nreview the interactions we measure to \\nmake sure we continue to focus on the \\nissues that matter most to our customers. \\nListening to customers and acting on their feedback has helped us to drive improvements to the customer experience. \\n Here are some of the main issues raised and how we responded.\\nArea of focus\\nAction\\nImproving the \\n ease and speed of \\naccount opening\\nIn the UK, we created a new welcome journey for small businesses. This resulted in improved customer satisfaction \\nand increased use of self-service digital tools. In France, we sped up the opening of accounts by simplifying the \\nprocess. In Singapore, new customers are now assigned a single point of contact to help them. A customised video \\nalso introduces customers to their service team and helps them to get started with online banking. \\nCustomer query \\nhandling\\nWe want to make sure our people are fully equipped to answer customer enquiries e˛ciently and e˝ectively. We \\nprovided additional training for customer service managers in our Global Trade and Receivables Finance business \\n in Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as for our HSBCnet telephone teams to improve their technical and soft skills. \\n In the UK, a query escalation process was introduced to improve our ability to resolve queries quickly and accurately. \\nEasy channels \\n to communicate \\nfeedback\\nIn order to help make sure our products and services meet customers™ needs, we have more than 200 customers \\n as active members of online panels in the UK, Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia, UAE, Mexico and the US. These \\nprovide fast feedback, allowing us to test changes directly with customers. In 2018, they helped us redesign our online \\nbanking platform and provided input into developments around integration of third-party accounting software.\\nCase study: Customer-centric \\npayments review\\nA customer-centric review was \\nlaunched to improve the e˛ciency \\n of our payment processing across \\nAsia-Paci˜c. We created a smoother \\nauthentication process through \\n a one-time password issued \\n to customers by text message. \\n This avoided three authentication \\nquestions, which customers told \\n us were di˛cult to use. Customer \\nqueries are now handled faster by \\ngiving wider access to the payment \\nsystems to our employees. These \\nchanges contributed towards a \\n 70% reduction of payments-related \\ncomplaints, from their highest point \\n in 2017, and a fall in average call \\nhandling time from 11 to seven minutes.\\n1. \\n Eight key markets: Hong Kong, UK, Pearl River Delta, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Customer satisfaction metrics for Pearl River Delta will \\nbe available from 2019. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and UAE, CMB performance in 2017 is based on the bank that the customer de˜nes as their \\nmain bank, while CMB performance for these markets in 2018 is based on the bank that the customer de˜nes as the most important. Surveys are based on a \\nrelevant and representative subset of the market. Data provided by RFi Group, Kantar and another third-party provider.\\n12Customers\\n\\nWhen things go wrong\\nWe support our people to help make \\n sure they handle customer complaints \\ne˝ectively, with a training module \\navailable to all relevant employees. \\n A new global complaints management \\nprocedure was delivered in the ˜rst \\nquarter of 2019 to help make sure we \\ncontinue to manage complaints in an \\nequitable and timely way, in an e˝ort \\n to provide e˝ective and fair outcomes \\n for our customers.\\nIn 2018, we resolved a total of 77,892 \\ncorporate customer complaints, which \\nwas a 35% year-on-year increase, with \\n81% coming from customers in the UK, \\n3% in France and 2% in the US. \\nWe have stepped up our ˜nancial crime \\nprevention procedures due to increased \\nscrutiny in this area, but as a result this \\nhas led to increased complaints from \\n our customers, representing more than \\n a quarter (27%) of total complaints. \\nDissatisfaction was often due to requests \\nfor additional personal and business \\ninformation to help us guard against \\n fraud and money laundering. Without \\nthose details, services were sometimes \\nrestricted and, in certain circumstances, \\naccounts were closed. After reviewing \\ncustomer communications, we have \\nimproved the content and layout of letters, \\nmaking the process clearer and simpler.\\nOperational complaints were the \\n second highest in volume (25% of total \\ncomplaints), re˚ecting the most frequent \\ncustomer transactions. Improvements in \\nthe payment processes and the way \\n we handle queries reduced complaints \\nsigni˜cantly in Asia-Paci˜c. We are keen \\nto learn from these events to improve \\ncustomer experience in other markets.\\nAccount opening complaints re˚ected \\n the third largest in volume (7% of total \\ncomplaints).

To help make sure all \\n our products meet customer needs, \\n we have a rigorous governance and \\n approval process for any new product \\n or signi˜cant changes to existing ones. \\nWe operate sales outcome testing \\n in 12 key markets designed to ensure \\ncustomers have understood the features \\nof their chosen products, such as pricing, \\nmechanics, risk and bene˜ts. In 2018, \\n we identi˜ed 132 issues through the \\nCMB outcome testing programme, such \\nas documentation, sales process, and \\npricing issues. Actions are underway to \\naddress these issues.\\nWe recognise it is important to provide \\nour products at a fair price and in a \\ntransparent way. Since late 2017, an \\nexecutive pricing steering committee \\n has been improving our existing pricing \\nframework to help make sure we \\n price products and services fairly, \\ncommunicate transparently, and have \\nrobust controls in place. Following our \\nfocused e˝orts, complaints around fees \\nand charges have fallen by 20% over \\n the last two years.\\nWe have put a strong emphasis on \\ncommunicating to our people on how \\n we should behave. We broadcast videos \\nof senior leaders speaking about what \\nconduct means to them and why it is \\nimportant. We feature examples of \\nemployees making the right decisions \\n in the interests of customers in global \\nemployee communications. Countries, \\nregions and global operations all held \\nconduct-themed workshops, informal \\nExchange sessions and town halls. \\n Spotlight: Conduct\\nThis has resulted in a signi˜cant input \\n of ideas and concerns that have allowed \\nour leaders to shape their own conduct \\nagendas and communications. For \\nfurther details of our Exchange forums, \\nsee the Employees section on page 22. \\nThe scorecards for front-line employees \\nare now balanced with a maximum \\n of 50% being related to performance. \\n We are increasingly seeing instances of \\nrole model behaviours driving upward \\nadjustments in variable pay from 1% \\n in 2015 to 8% in 2017.\\nFraud is a growing problem and we strive \\nto protect our customers from ˜nancial \\ncrime. In Mexico, we introduced training \\nfor our relationship managers focused \\n on business email compromise and \\nmalware fraud so they can pass on this \\nknowledge to customers and take the \\nright action if a customer is a˝ected.\\nan increase in complaints. In France, \\n rapid business growth during early 2018 \\nresulted in higher than expected account \\nopening requests, increasing the time \\ntaken to open accounts. Additional \\nresources were employed and changes \\nimplemented to streamline the process, \\nresulting in a reduction in complaints later \\nin the year.\\n1. \\n Volumes for the UK are received complaints from eligible complainants to align with the current FCA \\nreporting. Volumes of complaints for the rest of the markets are based on resolved complaints. \\n13Our Commercial Banking customers\\n\\nOur Global Banking and \\nMarkets customers \\nHow we listen to our customers\\nWe provide ˜nancial services and \\nproducts to governments, companies \\nand institutional clients around the world. \\nListening and reacting to customers \\n is one of the most important ways of \\nimproving our business.ˇOne of the \\nprimary ways we do this is through our \\nannual customer engagement survey. \\nCustomer satisfaction\\nIn this survey, 94% of our customers felt \\nour overall service and our commitment \\nto their business either improved or \\nstayed the same in 2018. Each aspect \\n of the survey is carefully reviewed to \\nconsider which actions can be taken \\n to improve customer perceptions of \\n us and the service we o˝er. \\nOne area where customers were \\ndissatis˜ed was our account opening \\nrequirements and how we update \\ncustomer information. Some customers \\nfelt that these were too cumbersome \\n and time-consuming. \\nAs a ˜rst step, our credit and lending \\n team is rolling out a digital credit platform, \\na service that provides customers with \\nstandardised, automatically populated \\ncredit documentation that can be signed \\ndigitally. This service, now available in the \\nUK, has reduced the time it takes for our \\ncustomers to receive ˜nancing. \\nWe are simplifying our know your \\ncustomer (‚KYC™) questionnaire and \\nworked with compliance to streamline \\nthe KYC aspect of customer onboarding. \\nThis improved our risk management \\nprocess and reduced veri˜cation times \\nby 25%.

We are placing a strong \\nemphasis on this, and reviewing the formal complaints \\nprocess in place for customers across all of the GB&M \\nbusiness lines to improve its e˝ectiveness. \\nNew tools have been adopted to better record complaints and \\ntrack their resolution. In November 2018, we created a new \\nglobal team to look speci˜cally at customer experience. With \\na broad mandate, it focuses on careful analysis of feedback \\nand rapid resolution of complaints. \\nOne of its immediate tasks is to consolidate customer \\nfeedback and complaints across multiple business lines, \\ngeographies and products. This should help us improve the \\ncustomer experience, and identify any areas for collaboration \\nor early detection of potential issues.\\nCustomer experience meetings are now scheduled regularly \\nwith our top management. These bring together senior people \\nto look closely at customer concerns and produce consistent, \\nbusiness-wide solutions. \\nwe collect and store KYC information, \\ntechnology solutions and data access. \\nWe reduced onboarding times for our \\ncorporate customer base by 8% by the \\nend of 2018. There is still a lot to do and \\nour target is to reduce this by a further \\n20% by 2020. \\nFor more information on some of the \\nways we have made it easier and safer \\nfor customers to access our services \\ndigitally, see page 18.\\nCase study: Improving payments processing \\nIn 2018, we were approached by a potential customer \\n who was looking for a new banking provider to resolve \\nproblems they had faced regarding delayed payments. \\nSta˝ salary payments had been repeatedly delayed, due \\n to a screening process that banks are required to carry \\n out to comply with regulations. This was an increasing \\nreputational risk for the ˜rm. When we looked into the \\nproblem for them, it focused our attention on similar \\n issues faced by our existing customers. Not only did \\n we win this ˜rm as a new customer, we also proposed \\n to take a proactive approach to screening payments \\n for existing clients, which noti˜es customers of any \\n delays and obtains additional information needed to \\nidentify and release blocked payments within a target \\n of 48 hours. By making sure we collect information on \\nregular bene˜ciaries upfront and use it e˝ectively, we have \\nsigni˜cantly reduced payment delays for our customers. \\n14Customers\\n\\nWhen things go wrong\\nOverall, the number of complaints \\nincreased in 2018, mainly in Global \\nLiquidity and Cash Management \\n(‚GLCM™) due to a number of signi˜cant \\nsystems upgrades and issues throughout \\nthe year. In most other GB&M \\nbusinesses, the number of complaints \\neither reduced or remained stable from \\n2017. In Global Markets, we had a \\nreduction in complaints resulting from \\nhuman error and processing issues in \\n our operations team. In Global Banking, \\nthe number of recorded complaints fell, \\nin part due to improvements to how \\n we record feedback. Previously, many \\ncomplaints that were related to the range \\nof products and services o˝ered by \\nHSBC were recorded by Global Banking, \\nwhere the overall customer relationship \\nis managed. In 2018, we have aimed, \\nwhere possible, to record speci˜c \\ncomplaints in relation toˇproducts and \\nservices against their speci˜c product \\nline such as GLCM and Global Trade \\n and Receivables Finance products.\\nSpotlight: Conduct\\nImproving employee conduct remains one \\nof GB&M™s core priorities as we continue to \\npursue the highest standards across every \\naspect of our business. The way in which \\nwe conduct business helps us ful˜l \\n our purpose of connecting clients to \\nopportunities and helping economies to \\ngrow, while staying true to our values. \\nCustomers rely on us for our ˜nancing, \\nadvisory and research expertise. They know \\nwe can access global debt, equity, currency \\nand commodity markets. It is vital that they \\ntrust us to manage their liquidity, keep their \\nassets safe, and ˜nance their trade. \\nIn 2018, we took a fresh look at how \\n to help deliver fair outcomes for our \\ncustomers, and help ensure we do \\n not cause disruption to the orderly and \\ntransparent operation of ˜nancial markets. \\nWe worked with third-party experts to \\nhighlight areas that needed improvement, \\nwhich led to a comprehensive new \\nprogramme to improve our conduct. The \\nkey areas of focus are highlighted below: \\nCulture and environment\\n ŒWe are expanding the dialogue \\n on conduct to help ensure we are \\nsupporting our people to make values-\\nbased judgements in situations they \\n face every day, and feel safe raising \\nconcerns. In the ˜rst half of 2018, 5,200 \\nof our people attended 650 Exchange \\nmeetings to discuss our conduct and \\nculture, with further Exchange meetings \\nheld through the rest of 2018.\\n ŒWe have developed a network of conduct \\nchampions across the business to help \\ndrive conduct awareness and provide a \\ngroup of enthusiastic, committed people \\nto act as local sponsors for behavioural \\nchange. We have led region-speci˜c \\nconduct weeks, where we highlighted \\nexamples of conduct in action across the \\nbusiness, and produced and updated \\ncountry-speci˜c conduct handbooks. \\n ŒWe have a complex footprint across \\ndi˝erent businesses, countries and desks. \\nThis can lead to a number of di˝erent \\ncultures Œ some of which will have issues \\nthat need to be addressed. In 2018, \\n we began a series of pilot exercises to \\nexamine the root causes of employee \\n and team behaviour, and to help design \\ninterventions. This will continue in 2019.\\n ŒWe introduced a new hiring guide \\n for managers to support the assessment \\n and selection of candidates, and \\nstrengthen our interview process \\n with a broader inclusion of values \\n and behavioural measures.\\n ŒOur management and sta˝ wanted more \\ntraining on conduct and how it applies \\n to them and their roles. We continue \\n to improve our conduct curriculum to \\nmeet this demand, including coverage \\n of behavioural drivers, con˚icts, grey \\nareas and speci˜c technical training.\\nEmbedding conduct in core \\nbusiness processes\\n ŒWe have created a Global Markets \\nproduct risk function and appointed \\nco-Heads of Product Governance in \\nGlobal Markets to improve product \\ngovernance. Product due diligence \\ntemplates used across GB&M have been \\nenhanced in an e˝ort to ensure conduct \\nis more carefully considered. Sales \\nsuitability procedures have been \\ndeveloped for people working in Global \\nBanking and the Institutional Client \\nGroup, and training has commenced \\n for Global Markets sales employees. \\n ŒIn our Exchange meetings on conduct \\n and culture in 2018, our people provided \\nfeedback that they wanted more support \\nunderstanding how pricing is determined \\nto support conversations with customers \\nand ensure consistency. New guidelines \\n on pricing and transparency have \\n since been agreed and published.\\nReinforcing our controls \\nframework \\n ŒDuring 2018, our businesses ran \\nexercises to encourage a deeper \\nunderstanding of the con˚icts of interest \\nthat can occur in investment banking. \\nThese captured a more granular view of \\nthe potential situations that our people \\nneed to be aware of and actively manage. \\nOver 100 workshops have been held to \\ncreate an inventory of con˚icts of interest \\nthat could arise within GB&M, bringing \\nbusiness lines and regions together. \\n ŒWe reviewed all our Global Banking \\nlocations to assess whether they are \\nsegregated from other business lines \\n from the perspective of information \\ncontrol and managing con˚icts of interest.\\n ŒWe work in an environment where we are \\nentrusted with privileged information that \\nwe have a critical responsibility to protect. \\nIt is vital that high levels of information \\ncontrols are in place. Improvements in \\ncontrols and procedures have been \\nintroduced during 2018. Over 31,000 \\nHSBC employees across all GB&M o˛ces \\ncompleted a bespoke training module on \\ninformation control procedures.\\n \\nFor further information on our approach to conduct \\nand the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.\\nGB&M annual complaint volumes\\n12018\\n2017\\nGlobal Markets\\n2201\\n273\\nGlobal Banking\\n330\\n417\\nSecurities Services\\n360\\n349\\nGlobal Liquidity and \\nCash Management\\n31,251\\n474\\nTotal\\n2,142\\n1,513\\n1. \\n A ‚complaint™ is de˜ned as any expression of dissatisfaction, whether upheld/justi˜ed or not, from \\n (or on behalf of) a former, existing or prospective customer relating to the provision of, or failure to \\n provide, a speci˜c product or service activity.\\n2. Global Markets also includes research.\\n3. \\n GLCM excludes complaints relating to payment operations.\\n15Our Global Banking and Markets customers \\n\\nHow we listen to our customers\\nActing on feedback\\nGiven the direct access our customers have to their relationship managers, issues are usually resolved quickly. However, the \\ncustomer engagement survey highlighted how some customers do not feel their feedback is addressed properly. In response, \\nwe are improving how we record feedback to ensure this is addressed in a more systematic way. \\nWe have three global strategic investment programmes underway focused on improving customer engagement and supporting \\nsustainable business growth. These programmes, overseen by the GPB executive committee, are in the following table:\\nWe serve the needs of high net worth \\nand ultra high net worth individuals and \\nfamilies, helping them to grow, manage \\nand preserve their personal wealth from \\ngeneration to generation.\\nBuilding strong personal relationships \\nwith customers is critical in private \\nbanking. Our customer service teams, \\ncomprising relationship managers, \\ninvestment counsellors, product and \\ncredit specialists, and wealth planners \\ninteract with customers on a daily basis, \\nlistening to and acting on feedback.\\nCustomer satisfaction\\nIn addition to this feedback, we conduct \\nan annual customer engagement survey. \\nIn 2018, more than 800 customers \\nshared their views on our people, \\nproducts and services. Our overall \\nsatisfaction score fell from 8.4 to 7.6 \\n(based on a scale of 1 to 10), falling \\n short of our threshold target of 8.0. This \\ndecline corresponded with a decline in \\nour customers™ perception of whether \\n we o˝er value for money, falling from \\n91% to 76%.\\nHowever, our customers continue \\n to be satis˜ed with our relationship \\nmanagement teams, scoring them \\n 8.4 out of 10, while 86% strongly agree \\nthat our portfolio reviews meet their \\n˜nancial needs, by providing a score \\n of either 4 or 5 (on a scale of -5 to 5). \\nOur Global Private Banking \\ncustomers \\nThe three themes that have emerged \\nfrom this survey, which we need to \\naddress are: \\n ŒWe need to improve perceptions of \\n the quality of investment advice and \\nproducts, which is falling short of \\nexpectations. \\n ŒWe need to keep pace with increasing \\ncustomer expectations. We have been \\nslow to implement a global digital \\nproposition and our customers have \\nexperienced a higher number of \\ninstances than is acceptable where \\n the service they have received from \\n us left them feeling annoyed or \\n let down. \\n ŒWe need to change outdated \\nprocesses. Some of our customers \\n feel our processes and procedures are \\ncumbersome, and as a consequence \\nwe may not be easy to deal with.\\nArea of focus\\nAction\\nAdvisory services\\nWe are enhancing our advisory proposition through investment in technology that provides more sophisticated \\nportfolio construction and risk analytics capabilities. This should help us to improve our investment processes \\nand provide more proactive, well-informed advice. To support this, we increased the number of customer-\\nfacing investment professionals and product specialists by 17% in 2018, and plan to make further investments \\nin 2019, including a comprehensive training programme.\\nDigital\\nWe are aware that our investment in digital wealth management capabilities has lagged behind those of \\n our competitors. This has had an adverse impact on customer satisfaction. In 2018, we developed online \\n and app-based capabilities that went live initially in the UK in February 2019 and which will be introduced \\n to all our key markets during the year.

Ongoing work to \\nstrengthen controls includes:\\n ŒSales suitability: We established sales \\nquality assurance (‚SQA™) teams in \\n 2017, enabling us to focus on improving \\nthe quality and consistency of our \\ninvestment advice. In 2018, more than \\n3,200 trades were sample tested, 93% \\nof which provided advice in line with\\n our standards, with identi˜ed issues \\nresulting in appropriate remedial action \\nincluding customer contact where \\nnecessary. The SQA teams also perform \\nthematic reviews, focusing on high risk \\nscenarios. Where deviations from the \\nstandards or issues are identi˜ed, they \\nare escalated and corrective action is \\ntaken, where required. \\n ŒSupervisory framework: We de˜ned a \\nnew framework in 2018, establishing \\nclear standards and guidelines for \\nindividuals with responsibility for \\nsupervising customer-facing employees. \\n ŒProduct governance and pricing: We \\nstrengthened our product governance \\nin 2018 with increased global oversight. \\nOur product pricing principles, set by a \\nglobal pricing policy and fair value \\nexchange criteria for speci˜c asset \\nclasses, are being embedded in all \\nbooking centres. \\nTraining our people \\n for fair outcomes\\nThrough the ongoing deployment of \\nrole-based learning, all customer-facing \\nteams completed conduct training as \\nrequired by their role in 2018.

Digital \\nmessaging is used to help our UK \\ncustomers with ˜nancial di˛culties \\nmanage their debt, including accessing \\ndebt consolidation services and charities \\nonline. Since launching this new service \\n in November 2018, we have received \\nmore than 17,000 visits. \\nFor our global and institutional customers, \\nwe became one of the ˜rst banks in 2018 \\nto roll out Face ID login globally. The Live \\nChat service on HSBCnet is now available \\nto more than 56,000 customers in six \\ncountries. It has consistently high customer \\nsatisfaction ratings, reaching 89% in July \\n2018. We were also the ˜rst foreign bank \\n in mainland China to allow customers to \\naccess services through WeChat.\\nMobile banking experience\\nWe have seen signi˜cant growth in \\nmobile adoption rates for our retail \\ncustomers, with the proportion of mobile \\nactive customers increasing by almost \\n50% in 2018. We have introduced new \\nmobile app features, such as remote \\ncheque deposit in the UK and Canada, \\nmobile chat in the UK, and International \\nEducation Payment Solution (‚IEPS™) in \\nChina, which allows customers to pay for \\ntheir children™s international education \\nfees from their mobile phones. \\nOur PayMe mobile app allows HSBC \\ncustomers and non-customers to send \\n and receive money instantly and for free. \\nPayMe has approximately 1.5 million \\nusers with over two million payments \\nmade each month, making it the number \\none peer-to-peer payments app in Hong \\nKong, according to the Hong Kong \\nMonetary Authority. \\nIn 2018, we launched new mobile apps in \\n˜ve markets, with improved functionality \\nsuch as biometric login and the ability \\n to put temporary blocks on cards. As \\n we continue our roll-out of new apps, \\napproximately 20% of active mobile users \\nstill use the legacy app, which lacks some \\nfeatures users expect. This can be seen \\nthrough low Apple App store ratings, \\nwhere our legacy mobile app scores an \\naverage 1.9 out of 5 compared with the \\nnew app scoring 4.8 in the UK and \\n 4.7 in Hong Kong.\\nOur new Business Express mobile app \\nhelps enable our commercial customers \\n to stay on top of their business ˜nances \\nany time, anywhere. Key features include \\nbiometric access through ˜ngerprint \\n or facial recognition, fast and accurate \\ntracking of recent incoming funds, \\noutgoing payments as well as all trade \\ntransactions, plus instant help from the \\nchatbot Ask Amy 24/7. New features will \\nbe added, including noti˜cations and \\nfaster payment journeys. \\nMachine learning/AI\\nArti˜cial intelligenceˇ(‚AI™) and machine \\nlearningˇare becoming easier to use \\nthrough our adoption of cloud computing, \\nopen source frameworks and commercial \\nsolutions.

Global business and \\nfunction risk owners in the ˜rst line are \\naccountable for identifying, owning and \\nmanaging the cyber risk. They work with \\ncontrol owners to help ensure controls \\nare in place to mitigate issues, prevent \\nrisk events occurring and resolve risk \\nevents if they do occur. These controls \\nare executed in line with policies \\nproduced by the second line information \\nsecurity risk teams and are overseen by \\nthe third line Œ the independent Internal \\nAudit function. \\nCyber risk and control e˝ectiveness \\n was reviewed 11 times at non-executive \\nDirector level, including by the Board, \\nGroup Risk Committee and Group Audit \\nCommittee.

We are focused on embedding a \\nculture designed to ensure data privacy \\n is at the heart of our organisation.\\nIn 2018, there were signi˜cant changes \\n to EU data privacy laws, with the General \\nData Protection Regulation (‚GDPR™) \\ncoming into e˝ect across the EU, while \\nnew data privacy legislation came into \\nforce in some non-EU jurisdictions. The \\nintroduction of the GDPR provided us with \\nan opportunity to review and reinforce our \\ndata privacy policies and controls across \\nthe Group, giving customers, employees \\nand stakeholders more transparency and \\ncontrol over how we use and manage \\ntheir information. A dedicated programme \\nof work was mobilised to execute and \\nembed GDPR requirements within HSBC \\nahead of its coming into force. We \\ncontinue to develop and focus our privacy \\ncapabilities in areas such as safeguards, \\nprivacy impact and risk assessments, sta˝ \\ntraining, education and raising awareness. \\nData privacy is regularly reported at \\nmultiple Group-level governance forums, \\nwhich include Board level representation \\nto help ensure appropriate challenge \\n and visibility among senior stakeholders. \\nIn addition, data privacy governance \\nstructures have been established within \\nthe Group. We continue to work towards \\nembedding ownership and accountability \\nof data governance across all businesses \\nand functions in an e˝ort to ensure \\ne˝ective management of risks.\\nIncreasing complexity in the matrix \\n of global data privacy laws, recent \\ndevelopments in data localisation \\nrequirements and the emergence of \\n new data-driven technologies continue \\n to challenge the banking industry.

Analysis in 2018 showed us that \\ntrust in leadership, career development \\nand recognising our people for their \\nbehaviour and performance drive a \\npositive response to this question. \\nIn late 2018, we expanded our Snapshot \\nsurvey to look at behaviours by asking \\n if people see others demonstrating \\n our values. The feedback allows us to \\nidentify areas for improvement and \\n take meaningful action in 2019. \\nWe see that 74% of our people feel able \\n to speak up when they see behaviour that \\nthey consider to be wrong. It tells us that \\nour speak-up channels are working, but \\n we know there is further work to be done. \\nExchange \\nOur Exchange forums provide a place for \\nour people to share their open and honest \\nviews.

In 2018, more than 720,000 recognitions were made \\n to a total value of $8.4 million. In 2018, we focused on HSBC sustainability, resulting in over 65,000 employee recognitions. \\nStories were shared as inspirational case studies on our intranet, HSBC NOW.

However, we \\nunderstand that in some circumstances \\npeople prefer a more discreet way to \\nraise their concerns.ˇ \\nWhistleblowing \\nHSBC Con˜dential is a global platform \\nthat allows people to raise concerns \\noutside of our normal reporting and \\nescalation channels in con˜dence \\n and without fear of retaliation. This \\n is available to all of our people, past \\n and present, in all global businesses, \\nfunctions and entities.\\nWithin this platform, we have \\n multiple channels to raise issues, \\n including telephone hotlines, online \\nportals and email. A broad range of \\n cases, covering a range of severity \\n levels, are dealt with each year. We also \\nmonitor an external email address for \\nconcerns about accounting, internal \\n˜nancial controls or auditing matters \\n (accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com). \\n In 2019, we plan to expand our use of \\n an independent third-party supplier to \\nmanage our 24/7 reporting hotline and \\nensure the service is available in the \\nGroup™s key local languages. \\nWe rely on our people to deliver fair \\noutcomes for our customers and make \\nsure we act with integrity in the ˜nancial \\nmarkets. A high standard of personal \\nconduct is critical for our ability to live \\n up to this commitment and ensure \\n a healthy working environment for \\n our people. We actively manage \\nmisconduct by taking any necessary \\naction, up to and including dismissal. \\n We monitor and report cases on \\n a regular basis to management \\nAll whistleblowing concerns are subject \\nto an independent investigation, which \\n is carried out by teams trained to handle \\nsensitive cases. These include human \\nresources, compliance, legal, information \\nsecurity and internal audit. Cases are \\nallocated depending on the concerns \\nraised. In 2018, 74% related to people, \\n12% to security and fraud, 11% to \\ncompliance, and the remaining 3% to \\nother categories. Following investigation, \\nwe take appropriate action if necessary, \\nincluding disciplinary action or \\nadjustments to variable pay and/or \\nperformance and behaviour ratings.ˇ\\n We learn lessons and change our \\nprocesses where needed. \\nHSBC does not condone or tolerate \\nretaliation against people who raise \\nconcerns and we strictly enforce \\n our policy relating to this.

We have \\nsigned up to the 30% Club campaign \\ncommitment to reach 30% women in \\nsenior leadership roles by the end of 2020. \\nIn 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership \\nwere women, above our goal of 27.6%. \\n In 2019, we are aiming for 29%. \\nTo help improve gender balance in \\n senior roles we provide mentoring and \\nsponsorship opportunities for talented \\nwomen. We extended our Accelerating \\nFemale Leaders programme in our \\n GB&M business to include our CMB and \\nGPB businesses. Through sponsorship, \\n the programme builds visibility and \\nconnectivity for Director-level female \\ntalent with leaders from across the Group. \\nIn 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership \\n were women, above our goal of 27.6%.\\nOur employee networks\\nOur seven global employee networks and \\nour HSBC Communities discuss issues our \\npeople care about and challenge us on \\nwhere we could be doing better. We have \\nmore than 140 groups with over 80,000 \\nparticipants. The networks focus on \\ngender, age, ethnicity, LGBT+, faith, \\nworking parents and carers, and ability \\n(including mental health). Our HSBC \\nCommunities focus on a variety of \\ncommon interest topics including ˚exible \\nworking, military and veterans, and \\nChinese culture. These groups play an \\nimportant role in helping us make progress. \\nOur largest global network, with over \\n48,000 participants, is Balance, which \\nworks to improve gender balance.\\nIn 2018, we introduced a global \\nmanagement structure for our LGBT+ \\nnetwork, Pride, to help network growth \\nand share best practice.\\nSpotlight: Gender pay gap \\nGender pay is an area of particular focus in the UK with the introduction of\\n the Gender Pay Gap (‚GPG™) Reporting regulations. We have complied with \\n the regulations and reported our 2017/2018 GPG. Our UK gender pay gap is \\ndriven by the gender imbalance within our businesses and functions. There \\n are fewer women in senior leadership roles, meaning that we have more men \\nearning higher salaries.ˇA higher proportion of women work in more junior \\n roles or work part-time hours. \\nWe are committed to improving gender balance and are taking a number \\n of speci˜c steps that we expect to have a positive impact in the UK over \\n time, including:\\n Œdriving better gender balance at all levels in the organisation˙\\n Œdeveloping female talent to strengthen the leadership pipeline˙ \\n Œsupporting families and ˚exibility˙ and \\n Œretaining female talent.\\nWe are con˜dent in our approach to pay and where we have identi˜ed pay \\ndi˝erences that cannot be explained, we have made appropriate adjustments.\\n1. \\n Combined executive committee and direct reports \\nincludes HSBC executive directors, Group Managing \\nDirectors, and their direct reports (excluding \\nadministrative sta˝) plus Company Secretary.\\n2. \\n Senior leadership refers to employees performing \\nroles classi˜ed as 0, 1, 2 or 3 in our global career \\nband structure.\\n24Employees\\n\\nWell-being and developing \\nour people \\n Employee well-being\\nA healthy and happy workforce \\n is essential for a positive working \\nenvironment.

While \\nwe have taken action, we know there is \\nmore to do. \\nIn October 2018, we held over 75 events \\nto support World Mental Health Day. \\nThis included a video interview between \\nJohn Flint, our Group Chief Executive, \\nand Brian Heyworth, our Global Head of \\nClient Strategy, sharing their perspectives \\non mental health at HSBC. This has \\nbecome one of the most viewed internal \\nvideos and helped open the conversation \\nwithin HSBC.\\nWe o˝er an employee assistance \\nprogramme so our people have free \\naccess to external expert assistance and \\ncon˜dential advice when they require it, \\nsuch as after su˝ering a bereavement or \\npersonal di˛culty. We advertise these \\nthird-party programmes locally so our \\npeople have the available information \\n to get the best support. \\nWe use our learning platform, HSBC \\nUniversity, to publish articles and \\nresources relating to mental health \\n from industry-leading bodies. \\nIn 2019, we will start to provide \\nwidespread mental health education \\n and support to our people, starting with \\n a programme of mental health education \\nfor all managers. Our focus will be on \\nspotting the signs of mental ill-health, \\nhaving open conversations and \\nsignposting the right support.

This helped \\nmore of our people make positive choices \\nthat meet their needs both inside and \\noutside of work. \\nOne of our HSBC Communities, Flex, \\nwhich supports ˚exible working, has \\n run global events on topics such as job \\nsharing.

Under \\nthe Paris Agreement, the country pledged to reduce \\nemissions by up to 41% by 2030 and recently adopted \\n the green sukuk framework to support its commitment. \\nTo fund climate mitigation and adaption projects in a \\nbroad range of sectors, as well as to demonstrate its \\ncommitment to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia issued \\nthe world™s ˜rst green Islamic bond, known as a sukuk, \\nfor $1.25 billion in February 2018. HSBC acted as joint \\nlead manager, joint bookrunner and sole green \\nstructuring adviser. This transaction represented the \\n ˜rst sovereign green sukuk, the ˜rst international green \\no˝ering by an Asian sovereign and the ˜rst Asian \\nsovereign green bond focused on Paris Agreement \\nambitions. \\n28Supporting sustainable growth | \\nSustainable ˜nance\\n\\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy \\nwill occur over a multi-year horizon and \\n it will take time for sectors currently \\ndependent on fossil fuels to adapt. While \\nit is acknowledged there should be a \\nsigni˜cant and immediate reduction in \\nthe use of coal to generate power, other \\ntraditional sources of energy, such as oil \\nand gas, have a longer term role during \\nthe transition. Developing countries may \\nalso need more time to adjust as they \\nbalance sometimes competing \\nsustainable development goals.\\nIn this context, we are working to \\n further understand the speci˜c risks \\n and opportunities climate change \\npresents to our customers, and we are \\ndeveloping our knowledge and capacity \\nto support their transition towards a \\n more sustainable future. We are doing \\n this through our engagement in the \\nEnergy Transitions Commission, \\n thought leadership articles published \\n on the Centre of Sustainable Finance \\n (www.sustainable˜nance.hsbc.com), \\n and other industry engagement.\\nIn 2018, we developed a transition \\n risk questionnaire with some of our \\ncustomers to improve our understanding \\nof their climate transition strategies. \\n This is helping us to identify which \\ncustomers need to adapt rapidly to \\nclimate-related risks, and spot potential \\nbusiness opportunities. In time, this \\ninformation can be incorporated into an \\ninitial assessment of transition risk within \\nour credit risk management processes. \\nWe plan to roll the questionnaire out \\nmore widely in 2019. We have also \\nembedded climate risk more broadly \\n in our risk management processes. \\n More information can be found in \\n the risk management section of \\n our TCFD disclosure on page 30.\\nAnother important element of our climate \\nrisk management is covered via our \\nsustainability risk management strategy. \\nSustainability risk is broader than climate \\nrisk. We de˜ne it as the risk that ˜nancial \\nservices provided to customers by the \\nGroup indirectly result in unacceptable \\nimpacts on people or the environment. \\nGroup Sustainability Risk, which is part of \\nthe Global Risk function, is responsible for \\nmanaging our sustainability risk policies \\n(covering agricultural commodities, \\nchemicals, defence, energy, forestry, \\nmining and metals, UNESCO World \\nHeritage sites, and Ramsar-designated \\nwetlands) and our application of the \\nEquator Principles. As with climate risk \\nmanagement, we seek to partner with \\n our customers to improve their operating \\nstandards. For more information on \\n how we manage sustainability risk, see \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nOur energy policy\\nOur approach is to support our \\ncustomers to transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy while limiting the ˜nancing of \\nhigh-carbon intensity energy projects. In \\n2018, we updated our energy policy and \\nset out our position with respect to new \\nproject ˜nancing of coal-˜red power, \\nOur approach to climate risk management \\n Engaging with our customers on palm oil\\nPalm oil is the world™s main vegetable oil. It requires less \\n land per output than other vegetable oils, and its production \\ncan bring wide economic bene˜ts. However, when produced \\nunsustainably, palm oil can lead to deforestation, resulting \\n in threats to endangered species, social con˚ict and \\n climate change. \\nWe have worked closely with our customers to support \\ncerti˜cation through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm \\n Oil (‚RSPO™), an independent organisation that sets standards \\nof good practice against which companies are independently \\ncerti˜ed. Internally, we have progressively raised our own \\npolicy standards. In 2014, we decided we would only ˜nance \\ncustomers that were already partly certi˜ed under RSPO and \\naimed to complete certi˜cation by the end of 2018. Customers \\nalso need to provide evidence of independent veri˜cation \\nunder their commitments to ‚No Deforestation, No Peat, and \\nNo Exploitation™ (‚NDPE™). Our agricultural commodities policy \\nis available online at www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nA number of our customers have chosen to operate \\nsustainably as a result of our engagement, including \\n 11 customers that have introduced NDPE policies \\n following discussions with HSBC.ˇAt the end of 2018: \\n ŒWe ˜nanced 22 customers engaged in palm oil \\n production that have either met our policy or will do so \\nshortly.ˇSeveral customers are in the ˜nal stages of full \\ncerti˜cation, managing external delays and resource \\nconstraints to meet our speci˜c requirements.\\n ŒWe have 31 customers who have operations in the palm \\n oil sector, but where we do not ˜nance this part of their \\nbusiness.ˇWe have engaged with those customers and \\nmany operate to or are working towards good practice.ˇ \\n ŒWe have 19 customers that do not meet our policy, \\n and we intend to discontinue the relationship when \\n existing loans have been repaid.ˇ \\ngreen˜eld projects in the oil sands, \\no˝shore Arctic drilling and due diligence \\nrequirements.\\nOur energy policy is available online at \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nHSBC™s exposure to coal mining\\nIn 2016, we updated our mining and \\nmetals policy, so that we no longer \\n˜nance new thermal coal mines or new \\ncustomers dependent on thermal coal \\nmining. We also committed to publicly \\nreport on our exposure to the coal mining \\nsector. At 31 December 2018, our \\nexposure to coal mining was $0.8bn, \\nunchanged from a year earlier. This \\nrepresents 4% of our total exposure to \\nthe mining and metals sector in 2018. \\nWe have adopted a new methodology \\n for the identi˜cation of exposures to \\n the metals and mining sector in order \\n to align with our TCFD disclosure. The \\nmethodology is explained in footnote 37 \\non page 67 of the \\nAnnual Report and \\nAccounts 2018\\n.Equator Principles in 2018\\nUnder the terms of the Equator Principles, \\nwe report annually on the transactions \\ncompleted under the Principles. In 2018, \\nwe undertook 18 transactions under \\n the Principles, compared with 20 in 2017. \\nA detailed summary of our transactions \\n and implementation can be found at \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk/equator-\\nprinciples.\\n29Sustainable ˜nance\\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚TCFD™)\\nWe all have a role to play in limiting \\nclimate change and supporting the \\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, \\n and we are a signatory to the disclosure \\nrecommendations by the Financial \\nStability Board™s task force. This \\nrepresents our second disclosure \\n under the framework. \\nGovernance\\nMitigating climate change is a key \\npriority for our senior leadership, with \\nsustainable ˜nance metrics included in \\nthe Group™s strategic priorities. In 2018, \\nthere were two presentations on \\nsustainability to the HSBC Holdings \\nBoard, two to the Group Audit \\nCommittee, four to the Group Risk \\nCommittee, and two to the HSBC Group \\nManagement Board. Senior leadership \\nhave engaged with regulators, industry \\nassociations and non-governmental \\norganisations on this topic, such \\n as through the Bank of England \\nconsultation on climate change, the \\nGroup Chairman™s participation in the \\nOne Planet Summit and the Group \\n Chief Executive™s designation as a \\n World Economic Forum climate \\n leader. A summarised list of HSBC™s \\nsustainability-related memberships is \\navailable at: www.hsbc.com/our-\\napproach/measuring-our-impact/\\nsustainability-memberships.\\nStrategy\\nSupporting the transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy is a key part of HSBC™s \\nstrategy, and new products have been \\no˝ered to facilitate this, along with a \\npledge to provide $100bn of sustainable \\n˜nance by 2025. To date, we have \\nreached $28.5bn of that goal. For further \\ninformation, see pages 26 and 28. We \\nrecognise many clients across sectors \\nare making signi˜cant shifts towards the \\nlow-carbon economy. During 2019, we \\nintend to develop new metrics to help \\nmeasure these activities, with an aim to \\npublish in next year™s disclosure. \\nWe believe education of our people \\n is crucial on this topic. We gave \\nsustainability training to more than 2,300 \\nemployees during 2018 and launched a \\nsustainability online learning programme \\nfor all employees globally, with content \\ndeveloped in collaboration with the \\nUniversity of Cambridge Institute for \\nSustainability Leadership. \\nWe report on the emissions of our own \\noperations via CDP (formerly the Carbon \\nDisclosure Project). This is available, as \\nwell as other information related to the \\nsustainability of our own operations, \\n at: www.hsbc.com/our-approach/\\nmeasuring-our-impact.\\nRisk management\\nWe are increasingly incorporating \\nclimate-related risk, both physical and \\ntransition, into how we manage and \\noversee risks internally and with our \\ncustomers. Climate risk is now included \\nas a theme in our ‚Top and emerging \\nrisks report™ to ensure that it receives \\nmonthly management oversight via the \\nRisk Management Meeting of the Group \\nManagement Board (‚RMM™) (see page \\n30 of our \\nAnnual Report and Accounts \\n2018\\n). In addition, our Board-approved \\nrisk appetite statement contains a \\nqualitative statement on our approach \\n to sustainability, which will be further \\nexpanded in 2019 to include climate \\n risk explicitly. \\nWe have a number of sustainability risk \\npolicies covering speci˜c sectors. In 2018, \\nwe updated our energy policy to limit the \\n˜nancing of high-carbon-intensity energy \\nprojects, while still supporting energy \\ncustomers on their transition to a low-\\ncarbon economy. From the release of the \\nnew energy policy in April 2018 until the \\nend of 2018, HSBC ˜nanced no new \\ncoal-˜red power plants. \\nTransition risk, in the context of climate \\nchange, is the possibility that a customer™s \\nability to meet its ˜nancial obligations will \\ndeteriorate due to the global movement \\nfrom a high-carbon to a low-carbon \\neconomy. HSBC is working to embed \\ntransition risk into its day-to-day credit risk \\nmanagement. The aim is that over time, \\neach wholesale counterparty will receive \\na client transition risk rating based on their \\nsusceptibility to, and ability to manage, \\ntransition risk. \\nWe have identi˜ed six higher transition \\nrisk sectors based on their contribution to \\nglobal carbon dioxide emissions. These \\nsectors are: oil and gas˙ building and \\nconstruction˙ chemicals˙ automotive˙ \\npower and utilities˙ and metals and \\nmining. Over time we may identify \\nadditional sectors as having higher \\ntransition risk depending on a variety \\n of factors, including country-level \\n carbon dioxide reduction plans per \\n the Paris Agreement.\\nThe table below presents our exposure \\n to the six higher transition risk sectors. \\nThese ˜gures capture all lending activity, \\nincluding environmentally responsible \\ncustomers and sustainable ˜nancing. \\nFurther details on our approach to the \\nquanti˜cation of exposures can be found \\nin footnote 37 on page 67 of the \\nAnnual \\nReport and Accounts 2018\\n. This is \\nexpected to evolve over time as we \\ndevelop new climate-related metrics.\\nNext steps\\nHSBC™s TCFD disclosures will continue \\nto evolve and expand over time. In line \\nwith TCFD recommendations, our \\nAnnual Report and Accounts \\nwill start \\n to disclose the additional climate \\nrisk-related metrics relating to our \\nportfolio for speci˜c sectors, as the \\navailability of su˛cient, reliable and \\nrelevant customer data permits.\\nSector\\n% of total wholesale loans and advances to \\ncustomers and banks in 2018\\n37Oil and gas\\n˘ 3.9%\\nBuilding and construction\\n˘ 3.8%\\nChemicals\\n˘ 3.9%\\nAutomotive\\n˘ 3.4%\\nPower and utilities\\n˘ 3.0%\\nMetals and mining\\n˘ 2.8%\\nTotal\\n˘ 20.8%\\nTotal wholesale loans and advances to customers and banks amount to $668bn.\\n  For footnote 37, see page 67 of the \\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2018.\\n30Supporting sustainable growth | \\nSustainable ˜nance\\n\\nOur approach with our suppliers\\nWe have globally consistent standards \\nand procedures for the onboarding and \\nuse of external suppliers.

Payment on time is of \\nparamount importance, and as such our \\ncommitment to paying our suppliers is in \\nline with the UK Prompt Payment Code.\\nSupplier ethical code \\n of conduct\\nWe have an ethical and environmental \\ncode of conduct for suppliers of goods \\nand services, which must be complied \\nwith by all suppliers. While our businesses \\nand functions are accountable for \\n the suppliers they use, our global \\nprocurement function owns the code \\n of conduct review process for them. \\nOur goal is to work collaboratively \\n with our supply chain partners on \\nsustainability at all times. When a \\nsupplier or one of its sub-contractors \\n is found to no longer be in compliance \\nwith this code, we will work with them \\non an improvement plan or, if deemed \\nnecessary, terminate the relationship. \\nThe ethical code of conduct, which we \\nrequire suppliers to adopt, sets out the \\nstandards for economic, environmental \\nand social impacts and outlines the \\nrequirements of having a governance \\nand management structure to ensure \\ncompliance with this code.ˇ\\nSuppliers \\n Our supplier management conduct \\nprinciples also set out how we conduct \\nbusiness with our third-party suppliers \\nboth in our legal and commercial \\nobligations.

In 2017, we \\ncommitted to ensuring that 100% of our electricity was sourced \\nfrom renewable sources by 2030, with an interim commitment \\n of 90% by 2025.ˇBetween 2012 and the end of 2018, we \\ncontracted up to 29% of our electricity consumption through \\nPPAs in various countries. As we strive to achieve our goal, \\n we are conscious of the challenges this will present, such as \\n in some markets in Asia where PPAs are currently unavailable. \\nWe are members of global initiatives, such as RE100, a \\n global initiative uniting more than 100 in˚uential businesses \\ncommitted to 100% renewable electricity, that aim to create \\n a united corporate voice to in˚uence countries™ policy to open \\nmarkets.ˇHowever, in some smaller Asian markets, our electricity \\nconsumption is too small for projects to be economically viable, \\nand therefore we will look to partner with other companies for \\n a collaborative solution. By ˜nding solutions to problems our \\ncustomers and other companies face, we are in turn solving \\n our own similar challenges, and \\nvice versa\\n. Our waste challenge\\nOur 2020 target was to reduce our total waste by 50% from our \\n2011 baseline. This was achieved in 2015, and then stretched \\n to reduce by 75% from this 2011 baseline. At 2018, we had \\nreduced total waste by 63%.\\nOur recycling target is for 100% of our o˛ce and electronic \\nwaste to be recycled by 2020. Since 2011, we have recycled \\n61% of our o˛ce waste. \\nWe are progressing well on our waste reduction target, however \\nour recycling goal will be a challenge to achieve. As we continue \\nto reduce our total waste, it becomes increasingly challenging to \\nincrease or maintain recycling levels. \\nWith di˝erences within cities and buildings, we continue to \\naddress the waste challenge by ˜nding ways to reduce waste, \\nsegregate and recycle. Most importantly, we continue to \\nengage with our employees to better explain and further \\neducate on local waste and recycling challenges.\\n29%signed renewable electricity from power purchase \\n agreements (2017: 27%)\\nAchieving our operational goals \\ncontinued\\n33Sustainable operations\\n\\nWe have a responsibility to invest in \\n the long-term prosperity of our global \\ncommunities.

We aim to \\nact with courageous integrity in all we do. \\nThis guiding principle means having the \\ncourage to make decisions based on doing \\nthe right thing for customers and never \\ncompromising our ethical standards \\n or integrity.\\nWe have also sought to learn from past \\nmistakes, such as the following three \\nexamples, and we are seeking to develop \\nand implement speci˜c measures \\ndesigned to prevent recurrence of similar \\nevents in the future.\\nAnti-money laundering \\n and sanctions\\nBetween the 1990s and 2010, as \\nacknowledged by HSBC in various \\nagreements with US and UK authorities \\n in 2012, HSBC failed to implement \\nappropriate anti-money laundering (‚AML™) \\nand sanctions controls. These oversight \\nand control failures resulted in HSBC \\nallowing at least $881 million in drug \\nproceeds to be laundered through \\n HSBC into the US ˜nancial system and \\napproximately $660 million in transactions \\ninvolving sanctioned countries, such \\n as Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma, \\n to be processed, in violation of applicable \\nUS laws.\\nIn December 2012, HSBC entered into \\nresolutions with, among others, the US \\nDepartment of Justice (‚DoJ™) and the UK \\nFinancial Services Authority (now the \\nFinancial Conduct Authority, or FCA), \\nregarding these past AML and sanctions-\\nrelated failings. Under these agreements, \\nwhich included a ˜ve-year deferred \\nprosecution agreement with the DoJ \\n (‚the AML DPA™), HSBC made payments \\ntotalling $1.9bn to US authorities and \\nundertook various further obligations, \\nincluding the retention of an independent \\ncompliance monitor. \\nRestoring trust \\n Over the past several years, we \\n have radically restructured our global \\noperations and signi˜cantly strengthened \\nour ability to combat ˜nancial crime. \\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility \\nto help protect the integrity of the global \\n˜nancial system. In order to ful˜l that \\nresponsibility, we have made, and continue \\nto make, signi˜cant investments in our \\nability to detect, deter and prevent ˜nancial \\ncrime. We have exited customers, \\nproducts and countries where we deemed \\nthe ˜nancial crime risk too high to manage. \\nWe are also working with governments \\nand other banks to advance our mutual \\ninterests in this area. These steps are \\nenabling us to much more e˝ectively \\nreduce the risk of ˜nancial crime.\\nIn 2012, we launched our Global \\nStandards initiative, focused on putting \\n in place the most e˝ective standards to \\ncombat ˜nancial crime across our \\noperations globally. As part of this \\n e˝ort, we designed and implemented \\nnew, globally consistent policies on \\n AML and sanctions that often extend \\nbeyond the requirements of local laws \\nand regulations. Since 2013, we also \\nestablished a Financial System \\nVulnerabilities Committee (‚FSVC™) \\n to oversee our ˜nancial crime risk \\nmanagement reforms. The FSVC reports \\n to the Board on matters relating to \\n˜nancial crime and ˜nancial system \\nabuse, and provides a forward-looking \\nperspective on ˜nancial crime risk, \\nanti-bribery and corruption.\\nAmong other steps, we hired experienced \\nsenior personnel to lead the e˝ort and \\nsigni˜cantly increased our ˜nancial crime \\ncompliance capabilities˙ we put in place \\n a robust investigations capability˙ we \\nimproved and expanded our ˜nancial \\ncrime compliance training initiatives˙ \\n and we upgraded or replaced key \\ncompliance IT systems, with over \\n $1bn spent since 2015.\\nBeyond these improvements, as part of \\nour commitment to protect the integrity \\n of the ˜nancial system, and to do our part \\nto ˜ght ˜nancial crime, we continue to \\nenhance our systems and are working to \\nintegrate our reforms into our day-to-day \\nrisk management practices so that our \\nprogramme is e˝ective and sustainable \\nover the long term. We are also renewing \\nour focus on anti-bribery and corruption \\nas part of a dedicated three-year \\nprogramme to advance the Group™s \\nanti-bribery and corruption risk \\nmanagement capability. As part of our \\ncommitment to the UN Global Compact, \\nwe have pledged to work against \\ncorruption in all its forms, including \\nextortion and bribery.\\nThe AML DPA expired in December 2017, \\nand we are pleased that our progress in \\nstrengthening our AML and sanctions \\ncompliance capabilities has been \\nrecognised. Our work in this area will \\ncontinue to be consistent with our \\nstrategic priority of safeguarding our \\ncustomers and delivering industry-leading \\n˜nancial crime standards.\\nOver the coming years, we aim to evolve \\nsigni˜cantly our approach to ˜nancial \\ncrime risk management by building \\nadvanced analytical capabilities, \\nincluding arti˜cial intelligence, designed \\nto help us target illicit conduct with \\ngreater sophistication and precision. \\n This will help us make a step change \\n in our e˝ectiveness at ˜ghting ˜nancial \\ncrime and set a new standard that aims \\nto lead the industry. We expect to be \\nfaster and more accurate at detecting \\npotential ˜nancial crime and ever more \\ntargeted in our risk assessments. We \\nexpect to generate actionable insight that \\nwe can use ourselves and provide to law \\nenforcement to help keep criminals out \\nof the ˜nancial system. This will bene˜t \\nthe Group, our customers and society \\n at large.\\n \\nFor further information about our compliance \\ninitiatives, see page 41.\\n37\\nCustomer tax evasion \\nPrior to 2011, our Swiss private bank \\nprovided its customers with standard \\nservices, common in the Swiss banking \\nindustry at the time, which enabled \\ncustomers to conceal their assets from \\ntax authorities and avoid paying their \\ntaxes. These services included, among \\nother things, the opening of encoded \\nnumbered accounts that kept the \\naccount holder™s name con˜dential \\n and the provision of ‚hold mail™ services \\nwhereby all mail was kept at the bank \\n for customers to avoid receiving letters \\n at their domestic addresses. Our Swiss \\nprivate bank, through certain of its \\nrelationship managers, o˝ered these \\nservices while it had access to \\ninformation enabling it to know, or \\n to suspect, that certain customers would \\nuse those services in order to conceal \\ntheir assets from tax authorities.\\nWhile HSBC has reached agreements \\nwith certain law enforcement authorities \\nto resolve investigations relating to \\nallegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, \\nmoney laundering and unlawful cross-\\nborder banking solicitation arising \\n out of these past practices, the Group \\ncontinues to cooperate in ongoing \\ninvestigations by other tax \\nadministration, regulatory and law \\nenforcement authorities around the \\nworld in connection with similar \\nallegations. We acknowledge that the \\ncompliance culture and standards of due \\ndiligence in our Swiss private bank were \\nsigni˜cantly lower in 2006 and 2007 than \\nthey are today. With hindsight, it is clear \\nthat we maintained too many small and \\nhigh-risk customer accounts and our \\nprivate banking business was stretched \\nover too many geographical markets, \\n all of which contributed to failings in \\nstandards, culture and controls. \\nIn recent years, our Global Private \\nBanking (‚GPB™) business has taken \\nsigni˜cant steps to address these \\nhistorical control weaknesses, most \\nnotably in Switzerland. Beginning in \\n2012, GPB developed a tax transparency \\npolicy that included enhanced know your \\ncustomer (‚KYC™) and AML procedures \\nand a review of existing accounts against \\npotential indicators of non-compliance \\nwith tax obligations.

Furthermore, GPB discontinued \\nits ‚hold mail™ service and has withdrawn \\nfrom markets where it has been unable \\nto conduct due diligence to a satisfactory \\nstandard on its customers.\\nAs a result of these reforms, the number \\nof accounts and total customer assets \\n of GPB have been signi˜cantly reduced \\nby this intensive de-risking exercise, \\nwhere we have put compliance and \\n tax transparency ahead of pro˜tability. \\nWhere we used to o˝er banking services \\nto customers in more than 140 countries, \\nGPB now focuses on 34 strategic \\nmarkets, with customer assets actively \\nmanaged down by $140bn between \\n2013 and 2018.\\nWhile GPB has resolved a number \\n of legacy issues relating to the \\n past, investigations into former \\n practices are ongoing in a number \\n of countries at the time of publication. \\n In addition, we acknowledge that \\n GPB™s role in providing ˜nancial \\n services to high-pro˜le individuals may \\nsometimes result in GPB receiving \\n undue media attention.\\n \\nFor further information about our Global Private \\nBanking customers, see pages 16 and 17.\\nForeign exchange conduct\\nPrior to 2013, our foreign exchange (‚FX™) \\nbusiness lacked adequate governance, \\noversight and risk management in order \\nto ensure compliance with safe and \\nsound banking practices and applicable \\ninternal policies. As a result, we failed to \\ndetect and address unsafe and unsound \\nconduct by certain of our FX traders, \\nwhich included the misuse of con˜dential \\ninside information to conduct FX trades, \\npossible agreements with traders of \\nother institutions to coordinate FX trading \\nand disclosure of con˜dential information \\nto traders of other institutions. \\nIn November 2014, HSBC agreed to \\nregulatory settlements with the FCA \\n and the US Commodity Futures Trading \\nCommission in connection with their \\nrespective investigations of HSBC™s \\ntrading and other conduct involving FX \\nbenchmark rates. In September 2017, \\nHSBC entered into a consent order with \\nthe US Federal Reserve Board (‚FRB™) \\n in connection with its investigation into \\nHSBC™s FX activities. Under the terms \\n of that order, HSBC agreed to undertake \\ncertain remedial steps and to pay a civil \\nmoney penalty to the FRB. In January \\n2018, HSBC Holdings plc entered into \\n a three-year deferred prosecution \\nagreement with the DoJ (‚FX DPA™), \\nregarding fraudulent conduct in \\nconnection with two particular \\ntransactions in 2010 and 2011. \\nSince the historical conduct described \\n in these agreements, we have introduced \\na number of measures designed to make \\nthe control environment more robust \\n and prevent these failings from recurring \\nin the future. We have dedicated, \\n and continue to dedicate, signi˜cant \\nresources to strengthen our systems \\n and controls. While the investigations \\nfocused speci˜cally on our FX activity, \\nthey have also given us good reason \\n to look again at other aspects of our \\nconduct more broadly within the Global \\nBanking and Markets (‚GB&M™) business. \\nImprovements to our conduct agenda \\nstarted more than four years ago and \\ncontinue to this day. We are enhancing \\nand accelerating progress made in \\nstrengthening and remediating our \\nsystems and controls and broader \\ncompliance culture through a newly \\nestablished GB&M Conduct Committee, \\nled by our GB&M Chief Executive O˛cer. \\nMarket experts are providing input. \\n The agenda focuses on culture and \\nbehaviours˙ customers, including \\nsuitability, con˚icts of interest, pricing \\nand transparency˙ markets, covering \\nmarket conduct, trade execution and \\ncompetition˙ governance and controls˙ \\nand strategy and business planning. \\nProgress is being tracked and reported \\nthrough our own governance channels, \\nas well as being reported to the FRB, \\n DoJ and our regulators in line with our \\nagreements with them all.\\nConduct is core to how we operate \\n and manage our business. We have \\nalready implemented improvements \\n to algorithmic trading to manage risk \\naround benchmark orders, and updated \\nour policies for sales, order handling, \\nmanaging con˜dential customer \\ninformation and con˚icts of interest, \\npre-hedging and market abuse. In 2018, \\nwe introduced further improvements to \\nthe management of sensitive information \\nthrough physical barriers, technology \\ncontrols and procedures. We have also \\ncontinued to invest in enhancing our \\nvoice, trade and electronic surveillance \\ncapabilities across the globe to improve \\nthe monitoring of telephone calls, instant \\nmessages and trades to spot potentially \\nimproper activity.

These changes created \\nclearer and stronger lines of authority and \\naccountability, which enable the Board to \\ndevote more time to priority areas.\\nBoard diversity \\nIn 2018, the Board™s diversity and inclusion \\npolicy was updated to help ensure HSBC \\nand its various stakeholders continue \\n to bene˜t from a Board that includes \\nDirectors from a range of di˝erent \\nbackgrounds and whose ethnicity, \\nexperience, age, geographical provenance \\nand gender more closely re˚ect the \\ndiversity of our customers and the \\ncommunities that we serve. The Board \\ndiversity and inclusion policy is available at \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/corporate-\\ngovernance/board-responsibilities. \\n  For further details on our diversity and \\ninclusion e˝orts, see page 24.\\nShareholder engagement \\nWe welcome enquiries from individuals \\non matters relating to their shareholdings \\nand HSBC™s business. Communication \\nwith shareholders is given a high priority \\nby the Board, and there is regular \\ndialogue with institutional investors. \\nDirectors are also encouraged to develop \\nan understanding of the views of major \\nshareholders. As Senior Independent \\nDirector, Jonathan Symonds is available \\nto shareholders if they have concerns \\nthat cannot be resolved or for which \\nnormal channels would be inappropriate. \\nHe may be contacted via the Group \\nCompany Secretary at 8 Canada Square, \\nLondon E14 5HQ.\\nExtensive information about HSBC and \\nits activities is provided to shareholders \\nin the \\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2018\\n, the \\nStrategic Report\\n and the \\nInterim \\nReport\\n as well as at www.hsbc.com.\\nCorporate governance regulatory \\nchanges \\nIn July 2018, the Financial Reporting \\nCouncil published the new UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code (‚Code™) together \\n with the revised Guidance on Board \\nE˝ectiveness. The new Code places \\ngreater emphasis on how the Board \\nconsiders the interests of all stakeholders \\nin its discussions and decision making, \\nand promotes a strong internal culture. \\nWe see the new Code as an opportunity \\nto further enhance our existing \\nstakeholder engagement, ensuring that \\nthe business as a whole can continue \\n to develop constructive and considerate \\nrelationships. We aim to include details \\n of this in the \\nAnnual Report and \\nAccounts 2019. \\n Sustainability governance \\nWhile the Board has oversight of the \\nGroup™s sustainability and ESG initiatives, \\nthe Group Management Board is \\naccountable for their delivery, re˚ected in \\nsustainability targets within the long-term \\nincentive scorecards for executive \\nDirectors, and selected scorecards of \\nGroup Managing Directors. The 2017 \\nlong-term incentive scorecards of \\nexecutive Directors incentivise achieving \\n a cumulative ˜nancing and investment \\ntarget of $30bn to $34bn for developing \\nclean energy and lower-carbon \\ntechnologies and projects that contribute \\nto the delivery of the Paris Agreement and \\nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals \\nover the three-year period to 31 December \\n2020. The 2018 long-term incentive \\nscorecards of executive Directors include \\nan ESG rank measure incentivising \\nachievement of ‚Outperformer™ \\nSustainalytics rating.\\nAs discussed in our TCFD disclosure on \\npage 30, the Board receives a half-yearly \\nsustainability update, covering topics such \\nas progress against the three sustainability \\npillars and non-governmental organisation \\n(‚NGO™) engagement. This helps ensure \\nour sustainability agenda remains \\nprominent at the most senior levels. \\nOur Climate Business Council coordinates \\nsustainable ˜nance activities across the \\nGroup, supported by various working \\ngroups within global businesses, \\nfunctions and regions. An ESG Steering \\nCommittee, chaired by the Group Chief of \\nSta˝, leads our approach on ESG topics, \\nincluding considerations related to \\nexternal disclosure and materiality. \\nA climate risk working group was \\nestablished in 2018, which seeks to \\nimplement the objectives of the Climate \\nBusiness Council through the development \\nof policy and limit frameworks designed to \\nprotect the Group from climate-related \\nrisks (including transition risk and physical \\nrisks) that are outside risk appetite. The \\nGroup Risk Committee is responsible for \\noverseeing enterprise risks that have an \\nimpact on the Group, including climate risk.\\nSee page 30 for our TCFD disclosure.\\n40A responsible business culture \\n\\nSafeguarding the \\n ˜nancial system \\n We continued to consolidate our \\nprogress in tackling ˜nancial crime \\n while launching initiatives in a number \\n of new areas.\\nOur Global Standards programme, \\nlaunched in 2013 to upgrade our ˜nancial \\ncrime controls, is now approaching its \\nconclusion. During 2018, we concentrated \\non completing some of the ˜nal elements \\nof the programme designed to ensure \\nmanagement of ˜nancial crime risk is well \\nembedded in our day-to-day activities, \\nwith robust governance and reporting to \\nenable performance to be assessed. \\nIn June, we set out new strategic priorities \\nincluding the aim of delivering industry-\\nleading ˜nancial crime standards. \\nDeveloping an intelligence-led approach \\n to ˜nancial crime risk management using \\nnew technologies and advanced analytical \\ntechniques is key to achieving this \\nambitious target. We made good progress \\non this agenda and will continue to develop \\nour approach in 2019 and beyond.\\nWe launched an anti-bribery and \\ncorruption transformation programme, to \\nenhance the policies and controls around \\nidentifying and managing these risks \\nacross the Group. We also launched a \\ntransformation programme to strengthen \\nour ability to ˜ght fraud and protect \\n our customers. \\n \\nFor more information on our Global Standards \\nand anti-bribery and corruption programmes, \\nsee pages 37 to 39.\\nTechnology \\nTechnologies such as arti˜cial intelligence (‚AI™) and advanced analytics will \\nenable us to tackle ˜nancial crime more e˝ectively. Our approach combines \\ndeveloping our own technology solutions with bringing in the best external \\ntechnology. \\nOur investment in a start-up company called Quantexa enabled our investigators \\nin 2018 to deploy a new software system to spot ˜nancial crime networks in near \\nreal time by looking at internal and external data to ˜nd possible links between \\nindividuals or companies. Working with another ˜ntech company, Caspian, \\n we have developed a system that assembles all the relevant information on a \\nparticular suspicious transaction. It then uses AI to recommend whether it should \\nbe investigated further, enabling our people to focus on the highest priority cases. \\nOur ˚agship intelligence-led initiative is a new approach that combines a \\n range of data sources to dynamically assess the potential ˜nancial crime risk \\nthat an individual customer presents. We believe it will enable us to be faster \\nand more accurate at detecting suspicious activity and more granular in our \\n risk assessments. During 2018, we developed a prototype that, while at an \\n early stage, has proved to be markedly better at ˜nding potential ˜nancial \\n crime than existing industry-standard methods. We will begin to implement \\n it in 2019, alongside existing systems. We continue to engage with regulators \\non our approach.\\nPartnerships\\nThe insights delivered by new technology will have the greatest impact when \\nwe work with partners. Public-private partnerships enable banks to share \\ninformation with each other, regulators and law enforcement. We are a \\nmember of all six public-private ˜nancial crime partnerships that have been \\nestablished around the world. Through our membership we can provide \\nbetter insight about suspicious transactions to law enforcement and receive \\nintelligence that helps us to better target our work in detecting ˜nancial crime.\\nWe continue to advocate for partnerships in other jurisdictions and for \\n the e˝ective operation of existing partnerships, including sponsoring public \\nresearch into the future of ˜nancial intelligence sharing due to be released \\n in 2019.\\nSociety \\nDuring 2018, we successfully trialled an approach to providing victims of \\nhuman tra˛cking in the UK with monitored retail banking facilities, working \\nclosely with charities that provide support to victims. The aim is to help the \\nvictims reintegrate with society and break the cycle of abuse. The accounts \\nwere trialled through a small number of branches and we will now make them \\navailable in other areas of the UK. \\nFinancial crime can have a devastating impact on the societies that we serve, \\nand we have taken active steps to reduce that impact. In October, we joined \\nthe task force established by United for Wildlife to coordinate ˜nancial ˜rms \\ntackling the illegal wildlife trade by helping prevent the ˚ow of illicit pro˜ts. \\nMembers of the task force signed up to a declaration that commits them to \\nsteps such as providing intelligence about the trade to regulatory bodies and \\nlaw enforcement agencies. \\nThe scale of our work \\nEach month, we screen over 658 \\nmillion transactions across 207 \\nmillion accounts for signs of money \\nlaundering and ˜nancial crime. In \\naddition, we screen approximately \\n130 million customers and 37.3 \\nmillion transactions monthly for \\nsanctions exposures.ˇDuring 2018, \\nwe ˜led over 85,000 suspicious \\nactivity reports to law enforcement \\nand regulatory authorities where we \\nidenti˜ed potential ˜nancial crime.\\n41\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˚˘ˇ˚˛\\n˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˚˘˝˘\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˚˛˝˜˚˜˚˜˚‘ˆ˜˚˜˚˜˚‘€˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘˝ˇ˝˝˘\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˚˛˝˜˚˜˚˜˚“ˆ˜˚˜˚˜˚“š˜˚˜˚˜˚˜˚Keeping a responsible \\n approach to tax \\n We seek to pay our fair share of tax in the \\njurisdictions in which we operate and to \\nminimise the likelihood of customers using \\nour products to avoid or evade tax. Our \\napproach to tax and governance processes \\nis designed to achieve these goals. \\nWe have established a formal tax risk \\nmanagement framework, which is \\ndesigned to ensure that tax-motivated \\ntransactions or products are not adopted by \\nthe Group. Signi˜cant investment has been \\nmade to strengthen our tax risk processes \\nand train sta˝ to identify instances of \\npotential tax evasion. There remain areas \\nwhere further improvements are required \\nand we are working to address these.\\nWith respect to our own taxes, we \\n are guided by the following principles:\\n ŒWe are committed to applying both \\n the letter and spirit of the law in all \\njurisdictions in which we operate. \\n This includes adherence to a variety \\n of measures arising from the OECD \\n Base Erosion and Pro˜t Shifting \\n (‚BEPS™) initiative. \\n ŒWe seek to have open and transparent \\nrelationships with all tax authorities. \\n As with any group of our size and \\ncomplexity, a number of areas of \\ndi˝ering interpretation or disputes with \\ntax authorities exist at any point in time. \\n We work with the local tax authorities \\n to try to agree and resolve these in a \\ntimely manner.\\n ŒWe have reduced the number of legal \\nentities located in very low or nil tax \\njurisdictions from 121 at the beginning \\n of 2015 to 46 by the end of 2018. This \\nprocess will continue throughout 2019 \\nand 2020, with the aim of ensuring that \\nthe HSBC entities remaining in such \\njurisdictions are regulated entities \\nessential for conducting business.\\nWith respect to our customers™ taxes, we \\nare guided by the following principles:\\n ŒWe have made considerable investment \\nimplementing processes designed to \\nincrease transparency and reduce the \\n risk of banking services being used to \\nfacilitate customer tax evasion and \\n˜nancial crime. These processes \\nincorporate requirements arising from \\nexternal tax transparency initiatives \\nincluding the US Foreign Account Tax \\nCompliance Act, the OECD Standard \\n for Automatic Exchange of Financial \\nAccount Information (the ‚Common \\nReporting Standard™), and the UK \\nlegislation on the corporate criminal \\no˝ence of failing to prevent the \\n facilitation of tax evasion.\\n ŒWe have processes in place to help \\nensure that tax-motivated products are \\nnot provided to our customers.\\n \\nFor further details on our approach to \\n ˜nancial crime and what steps we have \\n taken, see pages 37 to 39.\\n Our tax contributions\\nAs highlighted below, in addition to paying \\n$7.0bn of our own tax liabilities during \\n2018, we collected taxes of $7.6bn on \\nbehalf of governments around the world. \\n A more detailed geographical breakdown \\nof the taxes paid in 2018 is provided on \\npage 65 of the HSBC Holdings plc \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2018\\n.42A responsible business culture\\n\\nRespecting \\n human rights \\nBusiness does not exist in isolation: it \\n is part of communities and serves the \\npeople. We recognise the duty of states \\nto protect human rights and the role \\nplayed by business in respecting them, \\n in line with the UN Guiding Principles™ \\n(‚UNGPs™) Protect, Respect and Remedy \\nframework. We have signed, or \\nexpressed support for, a number of \\ninternational codes, as set out in our \\n2015 Statement on Human Rights.\\nIn 2018, we set up a Human Rights \\nSteering Committee, which is overseeing \\nthe development of our approach to \\nhuman rights. This approach will \\nincorporate new recommendations from \\ninitiatives such as the OECD™s general \\n Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible \\nBusiness Conduct, published in May 2018. \\nWe primarily re˚ect human rights \\nconsiderations as they apply to our \\npeople, our suppliers and our customers. \\nSome examples are provided below.\\nEmployees\\nWe are committed to an inclusive \\n culture where our people can be \\ncon˜dent that their views matter, their \\nworkplace is an environment free from \\nbias, discrimination and harassment, \\n and where they can see that \\nadvancement is based on merit. This \\ncommitment re˚ects the provisions of \\nboth the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights (‚the UDHR™) and the International \\nLabour Organization Declaration on \\nFundamental Principles and Rights at \\nWork (‚the ILO Declaration™), including \\nfreedom of association. For further \\ndetails on the diversity of our workforce, \\nsee page 24.\\nSuppliers\\nWe expect our suppliers to uphold \\nhuman rights in carrying out their \\nbusiness, re˚ecting the UDHR and ILO \\nDeclaration principles. Our ethical and \\nenvironmental code of conduct for \\nsuppliers requires them to respect the \\nhuman rights of their employees and the \\ncommunities in which they operate, and \\ncomply with all relevant legislation, \\nregulations and directives. During 2018, \\nwe undertook a risk-mapping exercise \\n to identify the most salient human rights \\nrisks in our supply chain, particularly \\nthose relating to modern slavery and \\nhuman tra˛cking. \\nCustomers\\nThe principal aim of the UNGPs is to \\nprevent human rights abuses. We seek \\n to ensure that the ˜nancial services we \\nprovide to our customers do not result \\n in an unacceptable impact on people \\n or the environment. We are a signatory \\nto the Equator Principles, which are \\nunderpinned by the International Finance \\nCorporation™s Performance Standards, \\nand which focus on issues including land \\nrights, child labour, forced labour, and \\n the rights of indigenous and local \\ncommunities. We work with our \\ncustomers to help them improve their \\nsustainability practices. Additionally, our \\n˜nancial crime teams actively seek to \\nidentify the proceeds of potential human \\nrights abuses to inform law enforcement \\nand take ‚bad actors™ out of the ˜nancial \\nsystem. A case study on this is contained \\nin our Modern Slavery Act statement. \\n  Modern Slavery Act\\nOur statement under the UK™s \\n 2015 Modern Slavery and Human \\nTra˛cking Act gives details of our \\n work in combating these particularly \\negregious human rights abuses. We are \\nraising awareness with our customers \\n in selected sectors and regions as part \\n of our annual credit review processes. \\nWe are educating our own colleagues \\ndirectly through training and indirectly \\nthrough communications. \\nStakeholder engagement\\nWe remain committed to developing our \\napproach to managing human rights risks \\nas they a˝ect rights holders. We attended \\nthe UN Business and Human Rights \\nForum in November 2018 and continued \\nour involvement with the Thun Group, an \\ninformal group of bank representatives \\nthat provides guidance on how the \\nUNGPs should be applied across banking \\nactivities. We support the UN Global \\nCompact™s promotion of sustainable \\n and socially responsible policies, and \\nparticipate in the UK Chapter™s Modern \\nSlavery Act working group. \\nIn 2018, we had contact with ˜ve civil \\nsociety groups where human rights \\nabuses were raised. These abuses were \\nalleged to have been committed by \\nHSBC customers. We investigate \\ncredible allegations of human rights \\nviolations as they are reported to us \\n via engagement with stakeholders. If \\nrequired, particularly serious issues \\nultimately pass to the Group \\nManagement Board. \\n 43\\nWe believe that the global economy \\n is better served by customers being \\n part of the regulated ˜nancial system. \\n In support of this, we carried out \\n a number of initiatives in 2018 to \\n increase access to ˜nancial services. \\n Our approach to ˜nancial inclusion \\n is focused on engaging with partners \\n to raise industry standards˙ improving \\naccessibility of products and services˙ \\nand investing in educational content. \\nWe acknowledge that increasing \\n˜nancial inclusion is a continuing \\n e˝ort, and there are a number of \\ninitiatives we will be focusing on \\n in 2019. These include: \\n Œimplementing the UK Finance Financial \\nAbuse Code of Practice, which aims to \\nincrease awareness for victims, potential \\nvictims, families and colleagues to \\nrecognise the signs of ˜nancial abuse \\nand to o˝er support where needed˙ and \\n Œlaunching our Age Friendly Banking \\ninitiative in Hong Kong to assist seniors \\nto better understand key concepts \\n and services such as third-party carer \\nbanking, digital banking and scam \\nprevention. \\nSupporting ˜nancial inclusion \\n We work with trade associations, \\ngovernments and regulators to identify \\nbarriers to ˜nancial inclusion and ˜nd \\nways to improve standards and share \\nbest practice. For example, in 2018: \\n ŒWe chaired trade body UK Finance™s \\nFinancial Inclusion and Capability \\nworking group and were involved with its \\nVulnerability sub-group˙ we were part of \\na cross-Whitehall working group, which \\nbrings together the government, banks \\nand policymakers to develop strategies \\non how UK banks can safely transfer \\nWe believe that in order for people to \\naccess and make the most of ˜nancial \\nservices they need to understand how \\n to use them e˝ectively to establish and \\ngrow their wealth. To deliver this in 2018:\\n ŒWe delivered more than 1,000 ˜nancial \\nwell-being seminars in the US, UK, \\nMexico, Singapore and Australia, \\nreaching more than 26,000 people \\nincluding more than 2,100 HSBC \\nfunds to high risk and sanctioned \\njurisdictions˙ and we provided \\norganisational and sta˛ng support, \\nincluding the chairmanship, to the \\n UK Financial Inclusion Commission.\\n ŒIn Asia-Paci˜c we hosted an insurance \\nindustry event as part of the annual Out \\nLeadership summit, where we shared \\nchanges made in our business to \\nrecognise modern family relationships, \\nand encouraged the industry to \\nbecome more inclusive in their \\nproducts and services. \\nemployees, as part our RBWM™s \\n Your Financierge service.\\n ŒWe began refreshing the content we \\nshare on our public websites, including \\nintroducing guides to modern money \\non our UK site. \\n ŒWe launched an online platform in the \\nUS with EVERFI to help our customers \\nand communities better understand \\nday-to-day money management and \\npreparing for the future. \\nWe believe that diversity helps us to ful˜l \\nour potential. We apply this philosophy to \\nour products and channels to help ensure \\nthey are inclusive and accessible for \\nindividuals and SMEs. To deliver this in 2018:\\n ŒWe improved our digital accessibility in \\n10 of our retail banking markets, so that \\nmore customers can access online \\nbanking. We also made physical services \\nmore accessible by starting a ‚barrier-free \\nbanking™ programme in Hong Kong to \\nupgrade our branch and ATM networks. \\n ŒWe o˝ered low- or no-fee banking \\nservices in selected markets for \\nindividuals who may not qualify for our \\nproducts. These services are provided \\nthrough basic accounts or waivers of \\nminimum balance requirements. \\n ŒWe expanded the bene˜ciary de˜nitions \\nof our life insurance policies in Hong \\nKong to recognise a broader range of \\nfamily relationships such as stepchildren \\nand same-sex couples. \\n ŒWe helped people experiencing cognitive \\ndecline access and maintain banking \\nservices through our Independence \\nService initiative in the UK, and through \\nour new Living with Dementia \\nprogramme in Hong Kong. \\n ŒWe expanded the use of third-party \\nalliances in Mexico so our customers \\nnow have 10% more locations where \\nthey can deposit cash and pay bills. \\n ŒWe announced a £12bn fund to lend to \\nSMEs in the UK, and continued to be a \\nshareholder in BGF Group plc (‚BGF™), \\nformerly the Business Growth Fund. \\nBGF provides patient equity capital to \\nsupport SMEs across the UK and \\nIreland.ˇIn 2018, the Canadian Business \\nGrowth Fund, which we helped to \\npromote and in which we are an \\ninvestor, made its ˜rst investments. ˇˇ\\nEngagement with partners\\nAccess to ˜nancial education content\\nAccess to products and services\\n44A responsible business culture\\n\\nAdditional \\n information\\n45\\nThis \\nESG Update\\n may contain projections, \\nestimates, forecasts, targets, opinions, \\nprospects, results, returns and forward-\\nlooking statements with respect to the \\n˜nancial condition, results of operations, \\ncapital position, strategy and business of \\nthe Group, which can be identi˜ed by the \\nuse of forward-looking terminology such \\nas ‚may™, ‚will™, ‚should™, ‚expect™, \\n‚anticipate™, ‚project™, ‚estimate™, ‚seek™, \\n‚intend™, ‚target™ or ‚believe™ or the \\nnegatives thereof or other variations \\nthereon or comparable terminology \\n(together, ‚forward-looking statements™), \\nincluding the strategic priorities and any \\n˜nancial, investment and capital targets \\ndescribed herein.

Ongoing and proactive engagement with these groups makes our company stronger and better \\n\\ninformed. It helps us gain valuable insight into our stakeholders™ perspectives and the topics that matter to them. It better enables us to \\n\\ndevelop products, services and programs that are responsive to their needs. This engagement also allows us to share information about our \\n\\n˜rm™s strategy, practices and performance.\\nResponsibility for engaging with stakeholder groups is widely shared across our ˜rm™s lines of business and corporate functions, and we \\nengage through numerous channels. For example:\\nShareholders \\nWe interact and communicate with shareholders through our \\n\\nInvestor Day, quarterly earnings calls, Securities and Exchange \\n\\nCommission ˜lings, Annual Report and Proxy Statement, \\n\\nannual meeting of shareholders, investor conferences, web \\n\\ncommunications and other forums. We conduct a formal \\n\\nshareholder outreach program focused on topics including \\n\\ncorporate governance, the ˜rm's strategy and performance and \\n\\nmatters related to the Proxy Statement. In these meetings, we \\n\\nsolicit shareholders™ perspectives and share information about \\n\\nour management of a range of matters, including ESG topics. \\n\\nFor example, the main areas of focus of our fall 2019 meetings \\n\\nwere executive compensation, corporate governance and climate \\n\\nchange strategy. After each of these outreach programs, we \\n\\nshare feedback from our investors with our Board. In 2019 \\n\\nwe reached out to our top 100 and select other shareholders, \\n\\ntogether representing over 50% of our outstanding common \\n\\nstock, and received feedback from shareholders representing \\n\\napproximately 45% of the ˜rm™s outstanding common stock \\n\\nacross more than 60 engagements.\\nWe also engage in dialogue outside of these more formal \\nchannels. These engagements provide us with useful feedback, \\n\\nwhich we consider when developing the strategic direction for \\n\\nthe ˜rm.Employees \\nWe share information with our employees and gather their input \\n\\nthrough our global Employee Opinion Surveys, regular town \\n\\nhall and small group meetings, blogs and newsletters, online \\n\\nsuggestion tools via our intranet and other forums. We also have \\n\\na variety of mechanisms through which employees can ful˜ll \\n\\ntheir obligation to report any known or suspected violation of \\n\\nour Code of Conduct, company policies or laws that govern our \\n\\nbusiness. This includes our toll-free Code Reporting Hotline, which \\n\\nis operated by an independent third party and o˛ers translation \\n\\nservices. Employees can contact the hotline to report concerns 24 \\n\\nhours a day, seven days a week. \\nRegulators and Policymakers \\nWe strive to maintain an open, ongoing dialogue with our global \\n\\nsupervisory regulators and a broad array of other policymakers. \\n\\nOur senior leaders and Directors commit a signi˜cant amount \\n\\nof their time to meeting with our regulators and policymakers, \\n\\nproviding opportunities for us to hear ˜rsthand about their \\n\\npriorities and to keep them informed about developments in our \\n\\nbusinesses. In addition, our businesses and control functions \\n\\nengage with regulatorsŠfor example, through exams and \\n\\ncontinuous monitoring, regular meetings and ad hoc requests. We \\n\\nshare reports with regulators on a range of matters. We also seek \\n\\nfeedback about whether they are getting the right level, quality \\n\\nand frequency of information.\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n6\\nCustomers and Clients \\nWe use multiple channels to solicit and respond to our consumer \\nbanking customers™ feedback about our products, services and \\n\\norganization as a whole.

Equally critical, we seek to create and \\n\\nreinforce a strong and healthy culture in which employees feel respected and empowered to do what is \\n\\nright for all of our stakeholders.\\nLeadership and \\nGovernance\\n Outstanding people, strong leadership and e˛ective governance and controls are the foundation of our success. Our senior management \\nteam develops the company™s strategic direction and oversees its execution, while our Board of Directors provides oversight of \\n\\nmanagement™s performance. In addition, senior management and the Board are charged with demonstrating, communicating and \\n\\nreinforcing the company™s commitment to doing business in accordance with our corporate standards and Business Principles.\\nBoard of Directors\\nOur Directors are a diverse group who bring a strong combination of executive experience and skills aligned with our business and \\n\\nstrategy. Apart from our CEO, all of our Directors are independent, under the standards established by the New York Stock Exchange \\n\\nand the ˜rm™s Corporate Governance Principles. We have a Lead Independent Director who is appointed annually by the independent \\n\\nDirectors and facilitates independent Board oversight of management. At our 2019 annual meeting, our shareholders elected to our \\n\\nBoard 11 Directors, including two women Directors and two black Directors. In 2020, two of our Directors decided to retire when their \\n\\nterms expire and one new Director has been nominated for election. Of the 10 individuals nominated at our 2020 annual meeting on May \\n\\n19, 2020, three are women and one is black.\\nThe ˜rm™s Corporate Governance Principles and the charters of the Board™s ˜ve principal standing committees establish a framework \\nfor the governance of the Board and oversight of the ˜rm. Among their responsibilities, the committees oversee a range of matters \\n\\npertaining to ESG topics. For example:\\n The Compensation & Management Development Committee \\n\\n(CMDC) reviews and approves the ˜rm™s compensation and \\n\\nbene˜t programs and oversees the ˜rm™s culture, which includes \\n\\nreviewing feedback from employees and cultural initiatives \\n\\nand updates from management regarding signi˜cant conduct \\n\\nissues and related employee actions. As part of its oversight \\n\\nresponsibilities, the committee also reviews the relationship \\n\\namong risk, risk management and compensation in light of the \\n\\n˜rm™s objectives, including the avoidance of practices that would \\n\\nencourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking. \\n The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee provides \\n\\noversight of the governance of the Board of Directors, including \\n\\nevaluation and recommendation of Director candidates. JPMorgan \\n\\nChase seeks Director candidates who uphold the highest standards, \\n\\nare committed to the ˜rm™s values and are strong, independent \\n\\nstewards of the long-term interests of shareholders, employees, \\n\\ncustomers, suppliers and the communities in which we work. \\n\\nIn addition to considering candidates who have the combined \\n\\nprofessional skills, experience, personal qualities, balance of \\n\\ntenure and collegiality needed for an e˛ective and engaged \\n\\nBoard, the Board looks for individuals who will contribute diverse \\n\\nviewpoints and perspectives to enhance its independent oversight.\\n The Risk Committee provides oversight of management™s \\n\\nresponsibility to implement an e˛ective global risk management \\n\\nframework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage \\n\\nthe ˜rm™s risks. The committee approves applicable risk policies \\n\\nand reviews certain associated frameworks, analysis and \\n\\nreporting established by management. \\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nADVANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n8JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n\\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of \\nmanagement™s responsibilities to ensure that there is an \\n\\ne˛ective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard \\n\\nthe assets and income of the ˜rm and maintain compliance with \\n\\nthe ˜rm™s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and \\n\\nwith laws and regulations. \\nThe Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the \\n\\n˜rm™s positions and practices on matters such as community \\n\\ninvestment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices \\n and other issues that re˝ec\\nt the ˜rm™s values and impact \\n its reputation. \\nOur annual Proxy Statement\\n includes details about the membership \\nand responsibilities of these committees.\\nManagement \\nThe design of our management structure is intended to \\n\\nencourage e˛ective leadership that is consistent with our \\n\\ncorporate standards and promotes a strong corporate culture. \\n\\nWe manage our ˜rm on a line-of-business basis, while also \\n\\nmaintaining strong corporate functions and appropriate \\n\\ngovernance of our subsidiaries. Within each line of business, the \\n\\nmanagement structure mirrors that of the ˜rm as a whole. \\nOur ˜rm™s most senior management body is the Operating \\nCommittee, which is responsible for developing and implementing \\n\\ncorporate strategy and managing operations. As of December 31, \\n\\n2019, women held 50% of the seats on the Operating Committee.\\nExecutive Compensation \\nOur ˜rm™s compensation philosophy is designed to be responsive to \\n\\nand aligned with shareholders™ interests and encourages a shared \\n\\nsuccess culture in support of our Business Principles and strategic \\n\\nframework. Our approach is driven by our recognition that the \\n\\nlong-term success of our ˜rm depends in large measure on the \\n\\ntalents of our employees and alignment of their compensation with \\n\\nperformance, business strategy and sustained shareholder value.\\nThe CMDC of the Board maintains independent oversight of our \\n\\ncompensation programs, including executive compensation. In \\n\\ndetermining compensation for Operating Committee members, \\n\\nthe CMDC uses a balanced and discretionary approach to assess \\n\\nperformance against four broad dimensions over a sustained period \\n\\nof time: (i) Business Results; (ii) Risk, Controls & Conduct, including \\n\\nfeedback received from the ˜rm™s risk and control professionals; \\n\\n(iii) Client/Customer/Stakeholder, including our engagement in \\n\\ncommunities; and (iv) Teamwork & Leadership, including creating \\n\\na diverse, inclusive and respectful environment and developing \\n\\nemployees, managers and leaders. These performance dimensions \\n\\nconsider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive \\n\\nsustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk, controls and \\n\\nconduct objectives.\\nThe intent of our compensation program is to incentivize long-\\nterm, sustainable decision making and to hold individuals \\n\\naccountable, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues \\n\\nthat negatively impact business performance or the ˜rm™s \\n\\nreputation. We maintain policies and procedures that enable us to \\n\\ntake prompt and proportionate actions with respect to accountable \\n\\nindividuals, including (i) reduction or elimination of annual incentive \\n\\ncompensation; (ii) cancellation of unvested awards; (iii) clawback of \\n\\npreviously paid compensation; and (iv) other employment-related \\n\\nactions, including termination of employment.\\nWe regularly review our compensation program and actively seek \\nout and consider feedback in making potential changes. In 2019, 72% \\n\\nof our shareholders voted in favor of our annual advisory resolution \\n\\nto approve executive compensation. In response to shareholder \\n\\nfeedback, the CMDC made enhancements to certain features of \\n\\nthe long-term equity awards made to the Operating Committee for \\n\\n2019, including revising the payout calculation methodology, setting \\n\\nappropriately rigorous absolute payout thresholds and updating the \\n\\nrelative payout scale. The CMDC also made several enhancements to \\n\\nour executive compensation disclosures. Our \\nProxy Statement\\n has a \\n\\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section that includes further \\n\\ndetails of our executive pay program.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n9INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nADVANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nOur Corporate Culture \\nHaving clear and consistent policies and processes is essential to sound governance, but creating a corporate culture that reinforces and \\nrewards adherence to them is equally vital. Our e˛orts focus on fostering an environment where all employees uphold the highest ethical \\n\\nstandards and our Business Principles in all of their engagements. We reinforce these expectations through various channels and by \\n\\nencouraging our senior leaders to communicate clearly and frequently with employees.  \\nOur e˛orts are also focused on promoting a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe and empowered at work. This includes \\nhaving in place employee training and protocols for preventing, reporting and addressing behavior that is not in line with our Business \\n\\nPrinciples and standards. The ˜rm prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports a concern or assists with an inquiry or investigation.  \\nAt the Board level, the CMDC provides oversight of the governance framework of our ˜rmwide culture, including receiving updates from \\nmanagement regarding signi˜cant conduct issues. In addition, the CMDC holds a periodic joint session with the Risk Committee in which \\n\\nDirectors are briefed on culture- and conduct-related matters.\\nOur Control Environment \\nOur control agenda is a top priority for the ˜rm, and we devote signi˜cant resources to adhering and adapting to the substantial \\n\\nnumber of regulatory expectations and reporting requirements that guide our industry. We have a culture and infrastructure \\n\\nthat emphasize compliance and issue escalation and remediation, as well as checks and balances designed to prevent issues and \\n\\naddress those identi˜ed before they become problems. We regularly engage regulators in dialogue as we develop appropriate \\n\\nremediation plans.  \\nOur ˜rm continuously seeks ways to strengthen our control \\n\\nenvironment and to simplify and appropriately mitigate risk in our \\n\\noperations. We dedicate signi˜cant ˜nancial and human resources \\n\\nto managing these e˛orts across the company.  \\nOur control environment, which is supported by other functions, \\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal, is structured as \\n\\nfollows, and additional details are available in our \\nAnnual Report\\n.Lines of Business Our ˜rm™s lines of business are each responsible for identifying and \\n\\naddressing risks within their respective businesses and operating \\n\\nwithin a sound control environment. The Control Management \\n\\nfunction, which consists of control managers within each of the lines \\n\\nof business and corporate functions, provides dedicated support \\n\\nto business leaders.

In addition, \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase is a leading voice on a global industry workstream \\n\\non regulatory harmonization, seeking to streamline the fragmented \\n\\ncybersecurity regulatory environment that is currently a patchwork \\n\\nof di˛erent standards, frameworks and requirements from over 150 \\n\\nglobal regulators. Our goal is to enable more e˚cient and e˛ective \\n\\ncybersecurity supervisory oversight, while also helping to increase \\n\\nsecurity and resiliency.\\nPolitical Engagement and \\nPublic Policy\\nJPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate \\ncitizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy \\n\\nand informed democracy through civic and community \\n\\ninvolvement. Our business is subject to extensive laws and \\n\\nregulations, and changes to such laws can signi˜cantly \\n\\na˚ect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we \\n\\nincur. Because of the impact public policy can have on our \\n\\nbusinesses, employees, communities and customers, we \\n\\nengage with policymakers on a range of issuesŠincluding \\n\\nbanking, ˜nancial services, cybersecurity, workforce \\n\\ndevelopment, small business, tax, trade and inclusive \\n\\neconomic growth, among othersŠto advance and protect \\n\\nthe long-term interests of the ˜rm. In addition, in 2019 we \\n\\nlaunched the JPMorgan Chase \\nPolicy\\nCenter to develop and \\nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions that \\n\\ndrive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the \\n\\nworld. The \\nPolicy\\nCenter™s ˜rst focus is removing barriers to \\nemployment for people with a criminal background. \\nThe ˜rm belongs to a number of trade associations that \\nadvocate on major public policy issues of importance \\n\\nto the ˜rm and the communities we serve. The ˜rm™s \\n\\nparticipation as a member of these associations comes \\n\\nwith the understanding that we may not always agree with \\n\\nall the positions of an association or its other members, \\n\\nand that we are committed to voicing our concerns \\n\\nas appropriate.

We strive to provide \\n\\nour clients and customers with exceptional service in everything we do.  \\nThis section focuses principally on our CCB business, which serves consumers and small \\nbusinesses across the U.S. under the Chase brand. We help our customers manage \\n\\ntheir money, purchase homes and vehicles, save and invest for the future, start and \\n\\ngrow businesses and achieve their financial goals. We do so by using our expertise to \\n\\nhelp our customers make the most of their money and by continually innovating and \\n\\ndeveloping products and services to enable them to bank however they chooseŠfrom \\n\\ntheir mobile phone, on their computer, at an ATM or at a Chase branch. \\nSince 2018, our firm has entered 16 new markets and opened more than 90 of the \\n400 new Chase branches we are planning across the U.S. as part of a nationwide \\n\\nmarket expansion effort. The new branches give us a presence in 38 states and \\n\\nWashington, D.C., as of year-end 2019.\\nWho We Serve:\\n63 million households \\n4 million small business customers \\n52 million activ\\ne digital users, includin\\ng \\n37 million active on mobile\\n2019ŒAt a Glance: \\nOriginated $105 billion in mortgages \\nOpened 8 million credit card acc\\nounts \\nReceived 35% of all check deposits \\n\\nthrough mobile phones\\nProc\\nessed an average of $3 billion in \\ncredit and debit payments every day \\nHelping Customers Make the \\nMost of Their Money \\nServing 63 million households, we have a deep understanding of the financial lives of \\nconsumers. We are using that insight to develop affordable, innovative and scalable \\n\\nproducts to help customers strengthen their financial health. \\nOne way we do this is by offering products designed to make it easier for our \\ncustomers to save and invest. For example, in early 2019, we introduced our low-\\n\\nfee Chase Secure Banking\\nSM\\n account (see p. 17), as well as Autosave, which lets \\ncustomers set up automatic transfers to their savings accounts and monitor progress \\n\\nthrough a savings dashboard. A total of 1.4 million customers used Autosave in \\n\\n2019, transferring $1.5 billion to their savings accounts. Also in 2019, we launched \\n\\nMy Chase Loan, which gives customers a hassle-free way to use the available credit \\n\\non their credit cards at a lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and with fewer fees \\n\\nthan a typical personal loan or cash advance. In addition, we empower all types \\n\\nof investors to build their savings and grow their wealth through our You Invest\\nSM\\ndigital investment platform. Approximately 90% of You Invest\\nSM\\n clients are first-time \\ninvestors with Chase.    \\nWe also created Credit Journey\\nSM\\n, a free, online tool to help consumers track and \\nmanage their credit scores. All consumers, whether or not they are Chase customers, \\ncan check their credit score at any time and receive alerts about changes, as well as \\n\\nlearn what affects their score and find advice on how to improve it.

During 2019, we originated over 1.1 million small \\n\\nbusiness loans for a total of $18.4 billion in the states where we \\n\\nhave a branch presence, an increase of 19% in capital extended \\n\\nfrom the year before.\\nWe know that minority, women, veteran and other underserved \\nentrepreneurs face distinct barriers to starting and growing their \\n\\nbusinesses, so we have a number of efforts designed to help \\n\\nthem get access to the capital, expertise and networks crucial for \\n\\nsuccess. For example, through our Women on the Move global \\n\\ninitiative, we are helping women start and grow businesses (see \\n\\np. 21), including a goal to provide $10 billion in credit to women \\n\\nbusiness owners through 2021. By the end of 2019, we had \\n\\nextended approximately $4 billion toward this goal, putting us \\n\\nahead of pace. \\nIn addition, we have committed $150 million in philanthropic \\ncapital to help underserved entrepreneurs build and grow their \\n\\nbusinesses. Through the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (see p. 25), \\n\\nwe support community lending organizations that provide \\n\\nminority entrepreneurs with access to capital, education and \\n\\nother resources. \\nWe are also using our global purchasing power to support \\ndiverse suppliers, spending more than $2 billion annually with \\n\\ncompanies owned and operated by historically underrepresented \\n\\ngroups, many of which are small businesses. Our firm is proud \\n\\nto be a member of The Billion Dollar RoundtableŠa nonprofit \\n\\nthat recognizes corporations that spend at least $1 billion with \\n\\nminority and woman-owned suppliersŠfor our commitment to \\n\\nsupplier diversity.\\nEngaging with \\nCustomers\\nWe regularly engage with our customers, consumer groups and \\nother stakeholders with a goal of developing products, services \\n\\nand approaches that are responsive to their needs and address \\n\\nthe issues that matter most to them. We have established \\n\\nforums, known as Chase Advisory Panels, for local, regional and \\n\\nnational stakeholders to share with our senior executives their \\n\\nperspectives on community development needs, public policy \\n\\nand regulatory issues. In addition, we conduct hundreds of \\n\\nmeetings annually with community-based organizations. \\nWe solicit customers™ direct feedback on their experiences and \\nneeds through a range of channels, including in person at our \\n\\nbranches, through our website, via social media and customer \\n\\nsatisfaction surveys. In addition, we collect customer feedback \\n\\nthrough external media and ratings agencies. We take this feedback \\n\\nseriously and use it to improve our approach and offerings.\\nHelping Our Small Business \\nCustomers Weather the Crisis\\nWe know how important small businesses are to their \\ncommunitiesŠand how much they rely on cash flow and \\n\\naccess to capital. So, when the COVID-19 crisis hit, we \\n\\nquickly took steps to support our small business customers, \\n\\nincluding allowing them to defer payments on loans, lines \\n\\nof credit and business credit cards. We are also providing \\n\\nmuch-needed capital by accelerating access to funding and \\n\\nextending new loans for our small business customers. We \\n\\nare working to help as many of our customers as possible \\n\\nreceive loans through the Small Business Administration™s \\n\\nPaycheck Protection Program.

We work to do this by having policies and procedures aimed at simplifying our disclosures, products and services \\nand operations; aligning our sales practices with our customers™ interests; and taking rigorous measures to safeguard the privacy of \\ncustomers™ information.\\nWe regularly review and look for ways to make it easier for customers to navigate our full range of products and services available across \\nour branch network. In addition, we are reevaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefits and taking \\nsteps aimed at ensuring the exercise of employee discretion in product accessibility works as intended.\\nProviding Fair and Transparent Marketing\\nWe want our customers to make informed choices about their \\nfinances and banking options, and we empower them to do so \\nby working to provide clear, concise and transparent information \\nabout our products and services. To deliver on this objective, \\nin 2019 we established the Disclosure Center of Excellence, a \\ncontrol team driving the consistent use of disclosures across our \\nCCB and AWM businesses. The team is responsible for ensuring \\nthat these businesses have access to up-to-date disclosure \\nlanguage that meets regulatory requirements and firmwide \\nguidelines so they can best serve their clients and customers. \\nAligning Employees™ Incentives with \\nCustomers™ Interests\\nOur objective is to provide our customers with the right products \\nand services to meet their financial needs, and we train, assess \\nand reward our employees accordingly. Every year, we train \\nour bankers on our customer-centered policies, procedures and \\ncontrols, and we evaluate their performance on these metrics, \\nalongside revenue and profitability. \\nWe reward bankers for providing customers with a positive \\noverall experience and products and services they need and use. \\nWe also review our sales practices, including culture, incentive \\nplans, controls assessments and feedback received from \\n\\ncustomers and employees through various channels, including \\nour employee Code Reporting Hotline. By merging all of this \\nfeedback, we help safeguard our reputation and align employee \\nperformance with the best interests of our customers.\\nProtecting the Elderly and Vulnerable \\nfrom Financial Abuse \\nWe continue our work to increase awareness about potential \\nfinancial abuse affecting elderly and vulnerable populations. To \\nbetter protect our customers, we look for innovative solutions \\nin data analytics and machine learning, while also concentrating \\non ongoing training and communication with our frontline \\nemployees. We are also working with nonprofit organizations, \\nadvocacy groups, regulators, law enforcement and others to \\nexplore strategies and best practices for combating exploitation \\nof elderly and vulnerable customers.\\nSafeguarding Customer Privacy \\nand Data Security\\nProtecting our customers™ personal and financial information \\nis a priority for our firm. We have robust internal policies and \\nsecurity measures aimed at keeping our customers™ personal and \\nfinancial information safe, and we hold our suppliers and vendors \\nto high standards for data security. \\nConsumers want to know our firm is safeguarding their personal \\ninformation and to understand how it is used. We strive to \\nprovide customers with clear, user-friendly explanations of our \\nprivacy policies that explain how we collect, share, use and \\nprotect their information, and outline steps they can take to \\n\\nlimit the sharing of personal information. We protect customer \\ninformation through a wide range of technological, procedural \\nand physical security measures. In addition, our Code of Conduct \\nand related policies for ethical business conduct include specific \\nguidelines about how employees should safeguard customers™ \\nconfidential information. \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n15INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nWe are investing in enhanced data privacy and security solutions \\nto safeguard information shared via our suite of online and \\nmobile banking tools. For example, in 2019 we announced an \\nagreement with leading data aggregator Envestnet l Yodlee, \\nwhich gives Chase customers more visibility and control of their \\ndata. With the new agreement, Envestnet I Yodlee will send 100% \\nof its requests for Chase customer data through our firm™s secure \\nApplication Programming Interface (API). This will give customers \\ncontrol over what is shared and with whom, including enabling \\nthem to monitor every financial app that retrieves their data and \\nsee all linked accounts and which information they are sharing. \\nWe also continue to expand our usage of machine learning and \\nintelligent strategies to improve detection and mitigation of \\nfraud across our products and services. This technology allows \\nus to more accurately detect potentially fraudulent activity for \\nour customers and approve more legitimate transactions. Each \\nyear, we anticipate these systems will help prevent nearly one \\nmillion more fraudulent credit card transactions that may have \\npreviously been approved, while simultaneously approving nearly \\none million additional legitimate transactions that would have \\n\\nbeen incorrectly declined. These machine learning capabilities, \\nalong with other initiatives, have also enabled us to reduce our \\ncredit card fraud loss rate by approximately 50% since 2014.    \\nServing Low- and \\nModerate-Income \\nCustomers\\nWe are committed to developing products and services that \\nmeet the needs of all segments of our customer base, including \\nthose specifically designed to serve low- and moderate-income \\ncustomers. This includes taking steps to make homeownership \\nmore accessible; expanding our branch presence in low- and \\nmoderate-income neighborhoods; offering resources in our \\nbranches such as financial coaching; developing products that \\nprovide safe, high-quality and affordable ways to access banking \\nservices; and more. \\nExpanding Homeownership\\nIn 2018, our firm made a five-year commitment to finance $50 \\nbillion of mortgages in low- and moderate-income communities. \\nBy the end of 2019, we had financed $22 billion of those \\nmortgages, or 44% of the five-year goal. \\nWe continue to serve more low- and moderate-income customers \\nwith our DreaMakerŽ mortgage, which allows buyers to make \\na down payment of as little as 3% and offers an affordable \\nmonthly payment. In 2019, DreaMakerŽ accounted for 21% of our \\nhome-purchase mortgages. With DreaMakerŽ, buyers can earn \\na $500 grant by completing a financial educational program to \\n\\nprepare them for homeownership. To reduce the cash required \\nfor closing costs and a down payment, we also offer a Chase \\nHomebuyer Grant of $2,500 to customers purchasing a home in \\nlow- or moderate-income census tracts across the U.S. More than \\n8,900 homebuyers benefited from this program in 2019. These \\nproducts and programs complement the suite of other affordable \\nloan products and programs we have long offered, including \\nFederal Housing Administration and U.S. Department of Veterans \\nAffairs mortgages.  \\nRecognizing that homeownership is not possible or desirable \\nfor some consumers, JPMorgan Chase is dedicated to creating \\nand preserving affordable rental housing for low-income \\ncommunities across the country. In 2018, we committed to lend \\n$7 billion over five years to commercial and nonprofit housing \\npartners to help maintain, rehabilitate and build affordable units. \\nBy the end of 2019, we had already lent $5.6 billion toward that \\ncommitment, including more than $3.3 billion in 2019 alone. \\nGrowing Our Branch Presence \\nOur retail bank branches are an important way that we serve \\nour customers and provide access to banking services. We plan \\nto open 30% of the 400 new branches in our market expansion \\nprogram in low- and moderate-income communities. We have \\na higher proportion of our branches and ATMs in low- and \\nmoderate-income communities across the country than the \\nindustry overall.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n16INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nWe are also expanding resources available at our branches, such \\nas financial coaching and advice. For example, we are piloting \\n\\na new branch model aimed at making our branches community \\n\\ncenters. We opened the first one in the Harlem neighborhood of \\n\\nNew York City in 2019. The branch offers unique programming in \\n\\nmoney management and financial planning; digital coaching on \\n\\njob, small business and computer skills; a pop-up space for local \\n\\nsmall businesses; and a hub for us to showcase and test new \\n\\nretail banking technology before it rolls out nationwide. \\nBroadening Access to Banking Services\\nAnother crucial way we support low- and moderate-income \\n\\ncommunities is by striving to create products that provide safe, \\n\\nhigh-quality and affordable ways to access banking services. For \\n\\nexample, in early 2019, we launched Chase Secure Banking\\nSM\\n, a Bank On certified checking account.\\n1 For a flat monthly fee, \\ncustomers get all the benefits of banking with Chase without \\n\\ncheck-cashing fees, minimum balances to open an account or \\n\\noverdraft fees. \\nWe know that small businesses also play an essential role in \\ncreating jobs and generating economic opportunity, especially in \\n\\nlow- and moderate-income areas. In 2019, we made more than \\n\\n265,000 small business loansŠtotaling more than $4.5 billionŠin \\n\\nlow- and moderate-income communities. That is approximately \\n\\n19% of our total small business lending. \\nIn addition, we support technology-based innovations to improve \\nthe financial lives of low- and moderate-income Americans \\n\\nthrough the Financial Solutions Lab (see p. 26), managed by the \\n\\nFinancial Health Network in collaboration with founding partner, \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase.\\nAdditional Online Resources\\nAccessibility at Chase\\nAnnual Report\\nBusiness PrinciplesChase Privacy Policy\\nCOVID-19 Response\\nFinancial Health\\nJPMorgan Chase Institute\\nProxy Statement\\nSmall Business ExpansionFor additional information, please visit \\n\\nwww.jpmorganchase.com/ESG\\n.1Bank On is Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund™s standard for safe, a˛ordable and appropriate accounts that meet the needs of low-income consumers.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n17\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nInvesting in Our Employees\\nThe success of our ˜rm is a direct re˝ection of the talent of \\nour people.

Diversity is a priority \\nthroughout our hiring process, and we seek candidates from a wide \\nrange of backgrounds and experiences for positions at all levels. \\nWe look to hire people who have the skills and expertise we need, \\nusing standard processes for assessing and selecting candidates.\\nBuilding a Strong and Diverse \\nTalent Pipeline\\nWe have a number of e˛orts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including \\ninitiatives focused on women, underrepresented ethnic groups, \\npeople with disabilities, veterans and others.\\nWe know that strengthening our pipeline of diverse future leaders \\nis essential, so we have campus recruiting programs that help us \\nconnect with diverse candidates for internships and post-graduation \\nroles as part of our Emerging Talent Program (ETP), which \\ncomplements existing recruiting e˛orts. The ETP team oversees a \\nrange of employment opportunities for cognitively, experientially \\nand traditionally diverse individuals who are often underrepresented \\n\\nin typical talent pipelines. To support our recruitment e˛orts, we \\nalso have structured partnerships with key diversity organizations, \\nand we have long-standing relationships with Historically Black \\nColleges and Universities (HBCUs). In 2019, our ˜rm was the top \\noverall employer at three HBCUs: Howard University, Morehouse \\nCollege and Spelman College.  \\nIn 2019, we continued to maintain best-in-class diversity hiring \\nfor our 2020 intern class, which was 47% female globally and in \\nthe U.S., 13% black and 16% Hispanic. This included e˛orts as \\n\\npart of our Advancing Black Pathways (ABP) initiative (see p. 21). \\nWe are equally focused on diversity in our experienced hiring, \\nwhich is delivering results. In 2019, for example, more than \\n55% of the Managing Directors we hired were diverseŠde˜ned \\nby groups of ethnicity and race, as outlined by the U.S. Census \\nBureau, and inclusive of women globallyŠan increase of nearly \\n15% compared to 2018. \\nCreating More Inclusive Inroads to \\nCareers at Our Firm\\nOur emphasis is on hiring people with the skills we need, not \\nparticular degrees. In fact, in 2019 more than 75% of the jobs \\nposted by JPMorgan Chase in the U.S. did not require a bachelor™s \\ndegree. While our ˜rm continues to value four-year college and \\nadvanced degrees, we are also increasingly turning to new and \\nmore diverse sources to recruit the talent we need. One way \\nwe are doing this is by partnering with community colleges and \\nrecruiting those with associate degrees. We are also looking to \\napprenticeship programs, bootcamps and other partners to create \\nmore inroads to careers at our ˜rm. For example, through our ETP \\n\\nportfolio we o˛er a range of apprenticeships and other entry-level \\nskill development opportunities. \\nThrough our Second Chance initiative, we launched an e˛ort to \\nexpand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to \\npursue careers at JPMorgan Chase (see p. 21). This means quali˜ed \\napplicants with criminal histories receive the same consideration \\nas any other applicant, and in 2019 it resulted in approximately \\n3,000 people with criminal backgrounds hiredŠroughly 10% of our \\nnew hires. We also launched a pilot program to further build our \\n\\npipeline for hiring people with criminal histories. \\nTraining and \\nCareer Development  \\nSupporting our employees™ professional development is a core \\nfocus of our human capital strategy. We invest approximately \\n$200 million a year in tools and training programs to help our \\nemployees build their knowledge, skills and experience. And, \\nin 2019, we delivered nearly 10 million hours of training to \\nemployees across the globe on topics including business processes \\nand products, leadership and professional development, risk \\nand compliance and technology, among others. In addition to \\nour internal training e˛orts, we provide tuition assistance to \\nemployees who are seeking to further build their skills. \\nWe also support employees by facilitating career advancement and \\nmobility within the ˜rm. In 2019, we ˜lled 42% of all positions and \\n67% of our most senior-level roles with internal candidates.\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n19\\nDelivering Best-in-Class \\nLeadership Training\\nLeadership Edge is our ˜rmwide initiative to enable leaders at \\nall levels to grow and succeed throughout their careers. The \\n\\nprogram, which has been recognized as a best-in-class leadership \\n\\ndevelopment platform, o˛ers in-person training focused on core \\n\\nleadership skills, people management and further embedding our \\n\\nBusiness Principles into our culture. By the end of 2019, 74% of our \\n\\n40,000 managers had attended one or more programs since the \\n\\nintroduction of Leadership Edge in 2015. \\nInvesting in New Skilling\\nWe are creating more paths for career mobility and preparing \\n\\nour employees to adapt to the trends that are transforming \\n\\njobs at our ˜rm through a concerted focus on new skilling. The \\n\\nemployees in the roles that will be most a˛ected by technological \\n\\nchangesŠsuch as our operations and entry-level positionsŠare a \\n\\nhighly diverse employee population. Providing these individuals \\n\\nwith opportunities to build skills that facilitate career mobility \\n\\nand improve retention is, therefore, a key part of our strategy to \\n\\nadvance diversity and inclusion within our ˜rm.   \\nWe are committed to providing employees with opportunities for \\nongoing development and career advancement. In 2019, through \\n\\nour Lifelong Learning program, we launched New Skills at Work \\n\\nto address talent needs across the ˜rm. We have proactively \\n\\nde˜ned business-critical future skillsŠsuch as data and tech \\n\\nliteracy, analytical thinking and project managementŠand we are \\n\\ndeveloping and expanding access to opportunities for our people \\n\\nto build the identi˜ed skills. The New Skills at Work program \\n\\nwill support employees as they navigate changes and compete \\n\\nfor emerging jobs at JPMorgan Chase. The goal is to expand the \\n\\nprogram in phases to all of our employees. \\nIn addition, through our Skills of the Future online curriculum, \\nwe are helping employees increase their digital ˝uency. In 2019, \\n\\nnearly 20,000 unique users took part in one of our Data and Tech \\n\\nLiteracy course o˛erings. And through our Power-Up Learning \\n\\nJourney, our ˜rm trained over 10,000 of our tellers, facilitating \\n\\ntheir career progression and graduation to Associate Bankers.\\nSkills-Based Volunteering\\nOur ˜rm leverages the talent of our people to maximize \\n\\nthe impact of our philanthropic programs. In 2019, 325 \\n\\nemployees from 14 countries contributed nearly 20,000 \\n\\nhours working with about 70 nonpro˜ts through the \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase Service Corps, our signature skills-\\n\\nbased program through which employees volunteer their \\n\\nskills and expertise to help our nonpro˜t partners build \\n\\ncapacity. And, through our Force for Good program, \\n\\n1,300 employee volunteers gave nearly 60,000 hours of \\n\\ntheir time to develop sustainable tech solutions for 200 \\n\\nnonpro˜t organizations. \\nIn addition to these programs, we provide a range of \\nother opportunities for our employees to volunteer \\n\\ntheir expertise to support the communities we serve. \\n\\nIn 2019, many employees around the world lent their \\n\\nknowledge and time helping drive more inclusive growth, \\n\\nfrom advising women-led businesses and mission-driven \\n\\n˜ntech entrepreneurs to mentoring young people from \\n\\ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\\nA Workplace for \\nEveryone\\nWe want to be an employer of choice for people from all \\nbackgrounds and experiences, and a place where all employees \\n\\nfeel like they belong. By striving to create an inclusive work \\n\\nenvironment that supports all heritages, cultures, abilities, work \\n\\nstyles and lifestyles, our goal is to attract and retain the best \\n\\npeople and be positioned to meet the diverse needs of our clients, \\n\\ncustomers and communities. \\nWe continually work to promote a culture of respect that allows \\nevery employee to feel safe and empowered at work. Our \\nEqual \\n\\nOpportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Statement\\nŠwhich we made publicly available on our website in early 2020Š\\n\\nsets forth our policies and expectations for our employees, and \\n\\nall employees are required to take anti-harassment awareness \\n\\ntraining. Additionally, we have implemented a framework for \\n\\nunconscious bias and inclusion training for managers, called \\n\\nJourney to Inclusive Teams, which provides training as well as \\n\\nother internal resources, such as decision-making tools and guides.   \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n20PROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\n\\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are an essential part of how \\nwe cultivate an inclusive work environment. These are groups of \\nemployees who volunteer to advance the ˜rm™s position in the global \\nmarketplace and diversity and inclusion strategies by leveraging \\nthe unique perspectives of their members. Our ˜rm has ten BRGs \\nglobally focused on ethnic communities and other groups, including \\nHispanic and Latino, black, Asian and Paci˜c Islander, military \\nand veterans, LGBT+ employees, women, people with disabilities, \\nearly career employees, administrative professionals and working \\nfamilies. Approximately 43% of our employees were members of at \\n\\nleast one BRG in 2019.\\nWe also have a variety of executive forums designed to support \\nand advance diversity and inclusion within our ˜rm. For example, \\nthe Hispanic Executive Forum serves as a senior collective voice \\nfor the Hispanic and Latino community and supports the Adelante \\nBRG and other Hispanic leadership forums across the ˜rm™s lines \\nof business; engages with external organizations; and supports the \\n˜rm™s campus hiring, new employee on-boarding and retention and \\ndevelopment e˛orts among the Hispanic and Latino community. \\n\\nThe Asian Executive Forum similarly partners with the AsPIRE BRG \\nand supports the ˜rm™s commitment to the Asian American and \\nPaci˜c Islander community through recruitment, development, \\nadvancement and external engagement. \\nHere are some other examples of how our ˜rm is taking a \\ndeliberate approach to supporting and investing in the success of \\nparticular communities: \\nChampioning Women\\nIn recent years, we have signi˜cantly expanded our Women \\n\\non the Move initiative, which we originally launched in 2013 \\nto provide women at all levels of our ˜rm with a platform to \\nexchange ideas and support their career development. Today, the \\nprogram focuses not only on women inside our ˜rm but also on \\nclients and customers through three strategic pillars: expanding \\nwomen-run businesses, improving women™s ˜nancial health and \\nempowering women™s career growth (see p. 14). We also continue \\nto support women™s advancement within the ˜rm. As of the end \\nof 2019, women made up 50% of our Operating Committee. \\n\\nIn addition, we are expanding our e˛orts to support working \\nparents and families (see p. 23). \\nInvesting in the Black Community\\nIn 2019, we marked the third anniversary of our ˜rm™s Advancing \\nBlack Leaders (ABL) strategy to increase representation of black \\ntalent across all of our businesses. While we have much more \\nto do, this strategy is delivering tangible results, especially \\nat senior levels of the ˜rm. We expanded the ABL strategy to \\nour Europe, Middle East and Africa region, which resulted in \\nour doubling the number of black Managing Directors in those \\nregions between 2018 and 2019.  \\nWe also launched ABP in 2019, which builds on the success \\nof our internal ABL strategy and extends our commitment \\n\\nto helping black Americans achieve economic success in our \\ncommunities. This initiative combines the ˜rm™s business and \\nphilanthropic resources to accelerate economic opportunity for \\nblack Americans by strengthening education and job training, \\ngrowing careers and building wealth. As part of this program, \\nwe committed to hiring more than 4,000 black students over \\nthe next ˜ve years into apprenticeships, internships and post-\\ngraduation roles. In 2019Šour ˜rst year working toward this \\ncommitmentŠwe achieved 25% of the target. \\nProviding Opportunities to \\nPeople with Disabilities\\nThe global O˚ce of Disability Inclusion (ODI) provides consistent \\nstandards and processes to better accommodate employees and \\nstrategic direction to the ˜rm with a focus on recruiting, hiring \\nand advancing individuals with disabilities. As part of the ˜rm™s \\ndisability inclusion and well-being strategy, we are also working \\nto reduce stigmas and dispel myths around mental illness in \\nthe workplace. This is MeŽ, the ˜rm™s ongoing mental health \\nawareness campaign, does just that through events, videos, \\ntoolkits and other resources. Nearly 100 employees have shared \\nstories about their mental health journeys on our corporate \\n\\nintranet. Additionally, about 80,000 employees leverage \\nmeQuilibrium, the ˜rm™s stress and resilience program. Our goal \\nis to make JPMorgan Chase the employer of choice for people \\nwith disabilitiesŠboth visible and hiddenŠby removing barriers \\nand providing the right level of support when they need it. \\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n21\\nHiring and Supporting Veterans\\nOur ˜rm™s O˚ce of Military and Veterans A˛airs drives our \\n˜rmwide strategy to support veterans through employment, \\n\\nentrepreneurship and private-sector leadership on veteran talent. \\n\\nSince 2011, JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 15,000 U.S. \\n\\nveteransŠincluding over 1,200 in 2019 aloneŠwith more than \\n\\n65% coming from diverse backgrounds.

We \\n\\nsupport our veteran employees through mentorship programs, \\n\\nacclimation and development initiatives, recognition events and \\n\\nother programs to help bridge the gap between military and \\n\\ncorporate cultures. Additionally, we o˛er paid military leave for all \\n\\ntypes of military service. \\nSupporting Our \\nEmployees\\nOur ˜rm is committed to supporting our employees, including their \\nphysical, emotional and ˜nancial well-being. \\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we put this commitment \\ninto action by taking steps to protect and support our \\n\\nemployees and their families. We implemented alternative work \\n\\narrangements and reinforced both personal and o˚ce hygiene \\n\\nmeasures to keep our employees and clients safe by modifying \\n\\nbusiness operations, staggering shifts, changing seating, closing \\n\\nbuildings to nonessential visitors and providing additional \\n\\nequipment where possible. \\nWe are continuing to pay branch employees for their regularly \\nscheduled hours, even if their hours are reduced or their branch is \\n\\ntemporarily closed. We are encouraging employees to stay home \\n\\nwhen appropriate by providing 14 days of full pay for precautionary \\n\\nsituations. In addition, for employees who felt they were higher \\n\\nrisk and could not work, we provided an extended leave through \\n\\nMay 2, 2020. And we provided ˜ve additional paid days o˛ for all \\n\\nemployees to help them manage personal issues, such as dependent \\n\\ncare, childcare or other needs. In addition, to help meet challenges \\n\\nrelated to issues like childcare and transportation, we are making \\n\\na special payment of up to $1,000 to full- and part-time employees \\n\\nwhose jobs require them to continue working on-site and generally \\n\\nhave annual cash compensation of less than $60,000.\\nSupporting the LGBT+ Community in \\nOur Workplace and Beyond\\nOur global PRIDE BRG, which focuses on the community who \\nidentify as LGBT+ and allies, had nearly 24,000 members in \\n\\n2019, up 35% from the year prior. In 2019, we also created \\n\\nour LGBT+ Executive Forum, a group of Out LGBT+ Managing \\n\\nDirectors and Executive Directors across 13 countries, to \\n\\ndrive increased engagement and visibility of our LGBT+ \\n\\nsenior leaders and advance topics important to our LGBT+ \\n\\ncommunity. In recent years, our ˜rm has taken a number of \\n\\nsteps to better meet the needs of this employee population. \\n\\nFor example, we have improved family planning bene˜ts and \\n\\ntransgender medical bene˜ts for LGBT+ employees, as well as \\n\\nrolled out same-sex partner bene˜ts and gender reassignment \\n\\nsurgery coverage in certain geographies. In recognition of our \\n\\nworkplace practices, JPMorgan Chase has received a 100% \\n\\nscore on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index \\n\\nevery year since its inception 18 years ago.\\nOur ˜rm™s e˚orts to advance equality and acceptance for those \\nwho identify as LGBT+ do not stop with our own workforce; \\n\\nwe are also lending our voice to e˚orts in our communities. \\n\\nIn 2019, for example, we signed public statements in support \\n\\nof marriage equality in Japan and Hong Kong, as well as a \\n\\nU.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in support of LGBT+ workers \\n\\nseeking to be protected from discrimination under existing \\n\\nfederal civil rights laws. We also engage with and support \\n\\nexternal LGBT+ organizations around the world.\\n Employee Compensation and Bene˜ts\\nWe o˛er competitive compensation and comprehensive bene˜ts. \\n\\nWe have governance mechanisms, systems and controls in place \\n\\nthat are intended to provide our employees equitable pay for the \\n\\nwork that they do, regardless of who they are. In recent years we \\n\\nincreased wages for U.S. employees at the lower end of our pay \\n\\nscale by 10% on average, ranging from between $15 and $18 \\n\\nper hour. \\nOur bene˜ts package includes health care coverage, retirement \\nbene˜ts, life and disability insurance, wellness and employee \\n\\nassistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, \\n\\ntuition reimbursement programs and more.

We o˛er all bene˜ts-eligible employees \\n\\nand their covered spouses/domestic partners access to annual \\n\\nwellness assessments and screenings to help our employees \\n\\nidentify potential or existing health risks. In 2019, 82% of enrolled \\n\\nemployees and 71% of spouses/domestic partners completed both \\n\\na wellness assessment and screening. \\nDuring the year, we continued to expand our programs to raise \\nawareness and reduce stigmas around mental illness and provide \\n\\nrelevant support to employees. All employees have access to our \\n\\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides con˜dential \\n\\ncounseling and support as well as manager consultationsŠeither \\n\\nthrough on-site counselors or our extended provider network. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we have 13 on-site clinical providers focusing on \\n\\nmental health and in 2019 we launched on-site EAP support and \\n\\ncounseling in London. We also launched new resources including \\n\\nvideos, a Manager and Employee Toolkit and a resource library on \\n\\nthe disease of addiction. \\nAssessing Pay Equity\\nWe conduct periodic pay equity reviews at all levels. In 2019, \\n\\nin aggregate, women globally were paid 99% of what men \\n\\nwere paid and U.S. minorities were paid more than 99% of \\n\\nwhat nonminorities were paid, taking into account factors \\n\\nsuch as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography. \\n\\nWe are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce. \\n\\nHowever, we also know that women and minorities still are \\n\\nnot represented in as many senior management positions \\n\\nas men and nonminorities.

This commitment included $150 million in low-cost capital to help underserved \\n\\nsmall businesses and nonpro˜ts access funding through community partners and a $50 million philanthropic investment to help address \\n\\nimmediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.

In 2019, \\n\\nwe launched the JPMorgan Chase \\nPolicy\\nCenter to develop and \\nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions designed to  \\n\\ndrive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the world.\\nThe ˜rst focus area for the \\nPolicy\\nCenter is advancing federal and \\nstate policy changes to remove barriers to employment for people \\nwith criminal backgrounds, such as ﬁbanning the boxﬂ on job \\n\\napplications and increasing access to education through Pell grantsŠ\\n\\nwhich provide ˜nancial aid to low-income studentsŠfor people \\n\\nin prison. One in three Americans has a criminal record, which \\n\\nconstitutes a signi˜cant barrier to employment for many people. \\n\\nProviding education, skills training and employment opportunities \\n\\nto people with arrest or conviction histories can have a huge impact. \\n\\nIt enables them to support their families, save money and secure \\n\\nstable housing. It also helps reduce recidivism, increase public \\n\\nsafety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. \\nAnother area of focus for the \\nPolicy\\nCenter is advancing local \\npolicy solutions that will enable more young peopleŠparticularly \\nthose who lack opportunityŠto access high-quality career \\n\\nreadiness programs that pave the way to well-paying jobs. And \\n\\nthe Policy\\nCenter will play an integral role as we respond to and \\nrecover from the impacts of COVID-19. \\nHarnessing the Power of Data\\nSound public policy is informed by timely, granular data.

We are working to create \\n\\ngreater economic mobility and career pathways for workers \\n\\ninside our ˜rm (see p. 20), as well as in our communities. This \\n\\nnew commitment includes $75 million to enable more young \\n\\npeople to get education and real-world work experiences. \\n\\nOur ˜rst investment as part of this commitment was $7 \\n\\nmillion to support Denver, Colorado™s nationally recognized \\n\\nyouth apprenticeship program and scale it to connect more \\n\\nunderserved students to degrees and credentials aligned with \\n\\nin-demand careers. \\nThese investments build on our ˜rm™s long-standing e˛orts \\nto support education, skills training and policy solutions that \\n\\nconnect job seekers to high-quality jobs in a changing economy. \\n\\nOver the past six years, we have helped more than 150,000 \\n\\npeople across 37 countries develop in-demand job skills. \\nSupporting Small Businesses\\nThrough our investments in communities around the world, we \\n\\nhave seen ˜rsthand how underserved, minority entrepreneurs have \\n\\nthe power to lift up communities. Yet these populations often face \\n\\nunique barriers that inhibit their success. This is why our e˛orts \\n\\nfocus on unleashing their power as drivers of opportunity. \\nThrough the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, we have provided \\nminority entrepreneurs in Detroit, Chicago, the South Bronx, \\n\\nthe Bay Area and the Greater Washington region with access \\n\\nto capital, education and other resources. Through 2019, we \\n\\ncommitted over $17 million through the Entrepreneurs of Color \\n\\nFund, resulting in more than 475 loans that created or retained \\n\\nover 3,000 jobs.\\nCultivating Thriving Neighborhoods\\nHousing that individuals and families can a˛ord, in proximity to \\n\\neconomic opportunity and basic services, is the cornerstone of \\n\\nvibrant and resilient neighborhoods. Producing, preserving and \\n\\nprotecting a˛ordable housing is essential to our strategy for creating \\n\\nthriving neighborhoods. For example, as part of a $75 million \\n\\ncommitment to the Bay Area our ˜rm announced in early 2020 \\n\\nthrough our \\nAdvancing\\nCities e˛ort, we are investing $27 million \\nto develop and preserve a˛ordable housing in San Francisco and \\n\\nOakland.

Our goal to facilitate $200 billion \\n\\nin 2020 to advance the SDGs builds on and expands the previous \\n\\ntarget we set in 2017, which was to facilitate $200 billion by 2025 \\n\\nin clean ˜nancing. This new 2020 goal includes approximately $50 \\n\\nbillion toward green initiatives that will also ful˜ll our 2017 clean \\n\\n˜nancing target.\\nWe established a new goal in 2020 because we were already nearly \\nthree-quarters of the way toward our 2025 clean ˜nancing target \\n\\nŠand because the environmental, social and economic needs \\n\\nthe world is facing require us to think bigger. E˛ectively tackling \\n\\ncritical global challenges like climate change requires addressing \\n\\nthe full spectrum of development needs, as re˝ected in the SDGs. \\nThis ˜nancing activity is principally led by our CIB and CB businesses, \\nwhich collectively provide strategic advice, raise capital, extend loans \\n\\nand o˛er risk management solutions for large- and medium-sized \\n\\ncorporations, governments and institutions. Our capabilities include:\\nUnderwriting debt with a sustainable use of proceeds. \\nIn 2019, JPMorgan Chase underwrote $14.6 billion in green bonds \\n\\nand bonds with a sustainable use of proceeds. For example, \\n\\nwe served as joint bookrunner on ReNew Power™s $525 million \\n\\nRestricted Group green bond issuance. ReNew Power is India™s \\n\\nlargest renewable energy independent power producer, \\n\\nwith more than 8 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity \\n\\ncommissioned and under construction.

As of year-end 2019, our Asset Management business had \\n\\nmore than $1.3 trillion of AUM in ESG-integrated strategies and $2.4 \\n\\nbillion in our suite of 11 dedicated sustainable investing products.  \\nAs a ˜duciary of our clients™ assets, we are committed to making \\nsure that the companies in which we invest focus on responsible \\n\\nallocation of capital and long-term value creation with an \\n\\ninvestment-led, expert-driven investment stewardship approach. \\n\\nOur Asset Management business supports and participates in \\n\\nindustry advocacy e˛orts aimed at addressing climate change, \\n\\nsuch as the TCFD and the United Nations-supported Principles \\n\\nfor Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative. And, in 2020, Asset \\n\\nManagement joined the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative to \\n\\nenhance its engagement with companies on climate-related risks \\n\\nand opportunities.  \\nOur Wealth Management business is also working to expand and \\nenhance how we help clients who want to pursue sustainable \\n\\ninvesting within their portfolios. Through white papers and other \\n\\nresources, we support our clients™ interests and share insights \\n\\non sustainability topics such as sustainable agriculture, circular \\n\\neconomy, electric vehicles and clean energy. \\nAcross equities, ˜xed income, alternatives and multi-asset portfolios, \\nWealth Management has 80 investment strategies globally geared \\n\\ntoward sustainable investing, with $7.3 billion in AUM as of year-end \\n\\n2019. These strategies span multiple approaches, including ESG \\n\\nintegration, exclusionary screening, thematic investing and impact \\n\\ninvesting. We continue to develop tools to help clients achieve their \\n\\nsustainable investing goals and new opportunities for our clients \\n\\nto participate in impact investing funds. For example, in 2019 we \\n\\no˛ered a new investment opportunity to Wealth Management clients \\n\\nthrough RRG Capital Management, which is an impact-focused fund \\n\\nmanager thatŠin partnership with The Nature Conservancy as a \\n\\ntechnical advisorŠraised a fund that aims to invest across multiple \\n\\nsynergistic themes such as water, farm acquisition and development, \\n\\nhabitat conservation and renewable energy and storage. \\nExpanding Our Firm™s Capacity \\n and Capabilities\\nTo support JPMorgan Chase™s commitment to advance the \\n\\nSDGs and meet growing client demand, we are expanding \\n\\nour ˜rm™s capacity and capabilities in emerging markets. \\n\\nIn 2020, we launched the J.P.

The group will also lead the development \\n\\nof our sustainable product o˚erings, enabling our clients \\n\\nto improve their sustainability credentials and access \\n\\nESG-focused capital. In addition, we have assembled a new \\n\\nEnergy Transition Team to provide strategic and ˜nancial \\n\\nadvice to corporate clients on mergers and acquisitions \\n\\nthat support carbon optimization objectives.\\nFinally, we have also established a Client Engagement \\nteam focused on driving high-impact conversations on \\n\\ncorporate responsibility and ESG-related topics with \\n\\nclients across our lines of business. \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n30INVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nManaging Risk\\nAssessing our clients™ approach to, and performance on, \\nenvironmental and social matters is an important component \\n\\nof the ˜rm™s risk management process.

In 2019, approximately 2,100 \\n\\ntransactions were referred to this team for review because a \\n\\npotential environmental or social risk was identi˜ed. These \\n\\nincluded loans, debt underwriting, equity underwriting and \\n\\nadvisory services. Detailed due diligence was undertaken on \\n\\nroughly one-third of the referred transactions. \\nJPMorgan Chase participates in or has adopted various \\ninternationally recognized principles that help guide our \\n\\ne˛orts on environmental and social risk management, \\n\\nincluding the Equator Principles. Further information about our \\n\\nimplementation of the Equator Principles and other principles is \\n\\navailable in our \\nFramework\\n. Expanding Our Focus on Climate Change\\nIn 2019, we published our ˜rst climate report that was guided \\n\\nby recommendations of the TCFD.

Our report discusses our \\n\\napproach toward managing climate-related risks and how we are \\n\\ncapitalizing on the opportunities that arise through a transition \\n\\nto a lower-carbon economy. Since our report was published, we \\n\\nhave taken a number of steps to integrate climate factors into our \\n\\n˜rmwide processes for identifying, assessing and managing risks. \\n\\nFor example:\\nWe created a dedicated risk team focused on climate.\\nWe integrated climate-related risks into the processes the ˜rm \\nuses to identify, assess and review the most material risks to \\n\\nour business.We are evaluating stress testing approaches to deepen our \\n\\nunderstanding of the relationship between climate change and \\n\\n˜nancial impact to our ˜rm.\\nWe continue to engage on policy through industry forums, \\n\\nsuch as the Climate Financial Risk ForumŠestablished by the \\n\\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory \\n\\nAuthority (PRA) of the Bank of EnglandŠas a member of the \\n\\nScenario Analysis working group.\\nPolicy Engagement\\nAddressing complex global challenges, including climate change, \\n\\nrequires collaboration and collective action. We participate in a \\n\\nvariety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability within \\n\\nour industry and across the corporate sector broadly. As part of \\n\\nthis, we share our expertise on issues at the nexus of ˜nance and \\n\\nsustainability, and learn from other companies and organizations.\\nIn early 2020, for example, JPMorgan Chase joined the Climate \\nLeadership Council (CLC), a think tank that is promoting a \\n\\nbipartisan roadmap for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend \\n\\nframework for the U.S. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase play \\n\\nan important role ˜nancing the energy transition necessary to \\n\\naddress climate change, and we believe the CLC™s roadmap is a \\n\\nstep toward advancing a bipartisan conversation about concrete \\n\\npolicy solutions. \\nTransparency and \\nReporting\\nJPMorgan Chase is committed to providing stakeholders with \\ninformation about our approach to and performance on ESG \\n\\ntopics. This annual ESG Report, which summarizes our work on key \\n\\nissues, is one of the primary ways we do that.

These events are expected to grow over timeŠand to disproportionately \\n\\nimpact the most vulnerable populations. While our ˜rm has a robust operational resilience program and a long track record of \\n\\nsupporting customers and communities after disaster strikes, we are taking an increasingly coordinated approach to helping \\n\\ncommunities prepare to withstand these threats.\\nIn 2019, we launched community resilience pilots in South Florida and Northern California. Informed by community input about the \\nmain challenges in responding to disasters, our ˜rm committed nearly $3 million in philanthropic capital to help these communities \\n\\ndevelop new informational tools, models of engagement and research that will help prepare them to be more resilient in the face of \\n\\nthe next disaster. Going forward, we are applying insights from these pilots to enhance our support. This includes working to expand \\n\\nour e˚orts to more communities that are vulnerable, as well as better aligning our community resilience strategy with immediate \\n\\ndisaster relief e˚orts.\\nOperational Sustainability\\nMinimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations continues to be an important part of our global sustainability strategy. \\n\\nIt also helps us to reduce costs and strengthen the ˜rm™s resilience. Given the nature of our business, our direct environmental impacts \\n\\nstem primarily from the operation of more than 5,400 corporate buildings, retail bank branches and data centers, including the electricity \\n\\nneeded to power those sites.\\nIncreasing Renewable Energy\\nIncreasing our support for renewable energy is a core part of \\n\\nour operational sustainability strategy. In addition to reducing \\n\\nenergy consumption by implementing energy-e˚cient lighting \\n\\nand other technologies, we are undertaking a range of actions, \\n\\nincluding: \\nInstalling on-site renewable energy \\nat retail branches and \\ncommercial buildings;\\nExecuting Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green \\n\\npower supply contracts \\nto support the development of new \\nrenewable energy projects on grids from which we purchase \\n\\nenergy; and\\nPurchasing Renewable Energy Certi˜cates (RECs) \\nto green \\n\\nour electricity supply.\\nWe will meet our 100% renewable energy commitment in 2020 \\n\\nby generating and purchasing energy and corresponding RECs \\n\\nin an amount equivalent to the total megawatt (MW) hours of \\n\\nelectricity that JPMorgan Chase consumes globally over the \\n\\nyear. The RECs we purchase will be sourced in accordance with \\n\\nRE100Šan initiative of The Climate Group and CDP to accelerate \\n\\nthe world™s transition to renewablesŠof which JPMorgan Chase \\n\\nis a member.

We use an operational control approach to de˜ne our \\n\\nboundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010. Emissions are recalculated back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5%  \\n\\nor greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-speci˜c data for fuel consumed and utilities purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs).  \\n\\nScope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual  \\n\\ndata collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO2 , CH4, N2 O, HFCs and PFCs. Our market-based GHG emissions include the impact  \\n\\nof renewable energy certi˜cates (RECs) purchased in the U.S. and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the U.K. All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America are  \\n\\nGreen-e certi˜ed. Emissions re˚ect supplier-speci˜c emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions re˚ect residual mix factors for European  \\n\\nfacilities. Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. \\n*The methodology to calculate Scope 3 emissions in Category 1 and 2 changed in 2016. As a result, 2016 and later emissions in these categories are not comparable to emissions in prior years. \\n\\n12Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby region\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsMetric tons CO2e75,407721,661797,06875,40786,743162,150\\nMetric tons CO2e1,47776,55978,0361,47776,55978,036EMEAMetric tons CO2e5,28135,78641,0675,2818,16413,445Latin AmericaMetric tons CO2e1312,0472,1781312,0472,178Greenhouse  \\ngas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsUnited StatesMetric tons CO2e75,253721,452796,70575,25386,534161,787IndiaMetric tons CO2e1,13948,49149,6301,13948,49149,630United KingdomMetric tons CO2e3,67731,86035,5383,6773,1346,811ChinaMetric tons CO2e16213,57713,73916213,57713,739Southeast Asia -  \\nSingapore, Malaysia, \\nPhilippines, Thailand,  \\nand IndonesiaMetric tons CO2e456,1896,234456,1896,234JapanMetric tons CO2e805,0205,100805,0205,100IrelandMetric tons CO2e5701,0651,6355701,8862,456AustraliaMetric tons CO2e81,4911,49981,4911,499ItalyMetric tons CO2e1738931,0661731,0291,201MexicoMetric tons CO2e5993799759937997South AfricaMetric tons CO2e1844346218443462RussiaMetric tons CO2e102321423102321423CanadaMetric tons CO2e1542093631542093632017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions\\n13Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissionsGermanyMetric tons CO2e02712720411412Saudi ArabiaMetric tons CO2e51982035198203BrazilMetric tons CO2e4314418743144187France\\nMetric tons CO2e112940112233Rest of world\\nMetric tons CO2e7983,4614,2587983,4774,274NOx, SOx, and other   \\nfrom direct combustionUnits \\n2010201520162017SOx Metric tons17111NOx Metric tons45252120COMetric tons56383331VOC\\nMetric tons4422PMMetric tons7233Ozone depleting substances Metric tons  \\nCFC -11e14171412Data are sourced from the Scope 1 and 2 inventory and records kept through our compliance program.

We use an operational control approach to dene our \\n\\nboundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010. Emissions are recalculated back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5%  \\n\\nor greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-specic data for fuel consumed and utilities purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs).  \\n\\nScope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual  \\n\\ndata collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO2 , CH4, N2 O, HFCs and PFCs. Our market-based GHG emissions include the impact  \\n\\nof renewable energy certicates (RECs) purchased in the U.S. and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the U.K. All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America are  \\n\\nGreen-e certied. Emissions reect supplier-specic emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions reect residual mix factors for European  \\n\\nfacilities. Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. \\n*The methodology to calculate Scope 3 emissions in Category 1 and 2 changed in 2016. As a result, 2016 and later emissions in these categories are not comparable to emissions in prior years. \\n\\n12Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby region\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsMetric tons CO2e75,407721,661797,06875,40786,743162,150\\nMetric tons CO2e1,47776,55978,0361,47776,55978,036EMEAMetric tons CO2e5,28135,78641,0675,2818,16413,445Latin AmericaMetric tons CO2e1312,0472,1781312,0472,178Greenhouse  \\ngas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissionsUnited StatesMetric tons CO2e75,253721,452796,70575,25386,534161,787IndiaMetric tons CO2e1,13948,49149,6301,13948,49149,630United KingdomMetric tons CO2e3,67731,86035,5383,6773,1346,811ChinaMetric tons CO2e16213,57713,73916213,57713,739Southeast Asia -  \\nSingapore, Malaysia, \\nPhilippines, Thailand,  \\nand IndonesiaMetric tons CO2e456,1896,234456,1896,234JapanMetric tons CO2e805,0205,100805,0205,100IrelandMetric tons CO2e5701,0651,6355701,8862,456AustraliaMetric tons CO2e81,4911,49981,4911,499ItalyMetric tons CO2e1738931,0661731,0291,201MexicoMetric tons CO2e5993799759937997South AfricaMetric tons CO2e1844346218443462RussiaMetric tons CO2e102321423102321423CanadaMetric tons CO2e1542093631542093632017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions\\n13Greenhouse  gas emissions \\nby country\\nUnits \\nScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2 \\nemissionsScope 1 \\ndirect \\nemissionsScope 2 \\nindirect \\nemissionsTotal  \\n\\nScope 1 \\nand  \\nScope 2  \\nemissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissionsGermanyMetric tons CO2e02712720411412Saudi ArabiaMetric tons CO2e51982035198203BrazilMetric tons CO2e4314418743144187France\\nMetric tons CO2e112940112233Rest of world\\nMetric tons CO2e7983,4614,2587983,4774,274NOx, SOx, and other   \\nfrom direct combustionUnits \\n2010201520162017SOx Metric tons17111NOx Metric tons45252120COMetric tons56383331VOC\\nMetric tons4422PMMetric tons7233Ozone depleting substances Metric tons  \\nCFC -11e14171412Data are sourced from the Scope 1 and 2 inventory and records kept through our compliance program.

At Apollo Global Management and \\nits subsidiaries (Apollo), we have a long-term practice of using ESG \\nfactors in our investment management strategy and believe that \\ncareful attention to such factors makes good business sense.\\nAs applicable and appropriate, Apollo:\\n  Incorporates\\n ESG issues into its investment analysis \\n and decision-making processes;\\n  Engages\\n on ESG issues with applicable investments it manages;\\n  Seeks\\n appropriate and applicable disclosure on \\n ESG issues by investments it manages;\\n  Reports\\n on its ESG activities and progress to limited partners; and\\n  Supports\\n the implementation of ESG practices \\n in the investment management industry.\\nAPOLLOS RESPONSIBLE\\n INVESTING MISSION STATEMENT\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n\\n1Scott Kleinman\\n Co-President\\nLead Partner, \\n Private Equity \\nJim Zelter\\n Co-President\\nChief Investment Oicer, \\nCredit\\nLaurie Medley\\n Chief Responsible \\nInvesting Oicer\\nGeneral Counsel, \\n Private Equity\\nWe are proud to publish Apollos 10th Annual ESG Report. Since adopting our \\nResponsible Investing Mission Statement in 2008, Apollo has collected ESG data \\nfrom the companies owned by funds that we manage. Not only does this data \\n form the basis for our Annual ESG Reports, but it is also useful to the portfolio \\ncompanies themselves, who, with the help of outside experts and counsel, are \\nbetter positioned to drive value by identifying, monitoring, and measuring the \\nsuccess of their own ESG programs and initiatives.\\nWe appreciate that the tracking, collecting, and reporting of ESG data requires considerable time and eort; \\nhowever, we believe strongly that this is not only a worthwhile exercise, but an essential one. As a irm that \\n seeks out uncommon opportunities for investors, Apollo believes companies that actively manage ESG risks \\n and seize ESG opportunities are more sustainable companies that are better positioned for long-term growth \\nand success. Corporate decisions that aect the environment, employees, and communities have become a \\nfocus of attention for all stakeholders, including customers, regulators, investors, and the general public. \\nApollos ESG Reporting Program continues to be recognized as a leader in the industry. Over the course of the \\nlast ten years, we have helped dozens of our funds portfolio companies to evolve from anecdotal to inancial-\\nstyle reporting of ESG data, and to increasingly view ESG as a driver of value and not solely through the lenses \\nof risk management and compliance. Apollo continues to review the developing landscape of ESG reporting \\nand, with input from expert advisors, portfolio companies, and investors, to provide what we see as an industry-\\nleading methodology for evaluating companies ESG performance. We have come a long way in the last \\n decade, and we are excited to embark on another ten years of responsible investing at Apollo.\\nFROM APOLLOS LEADERS \\n\\n$815,230,095donated by portfolio companies \\n to charitable organizations\\ntotal weight of waste recycled\\nApollo Celebrates \\na Decade of Achievement\\n375+19.8M\\n120\\n+37ESG webinars \\nportfolio company \\n ESG reports submitted \\n to Apolloportfolio companies that have \\nparticipated in Apollos ESG \\nReporting Program\\n\\ntotal weight of waste recycled\\nApollo Celebrates \\na Decade of Achievement\\n21,000\\n+19.8M\\n37945,000\\n+hours volunteered by portfolio \\ncompany employees\\n95Number of Portfolio \\n Companies Reporting\\nportfolio \\ncompany \\n site visits\\nindividual  ESG data \\n points reported \\nby portfolio \\ncompanies\\n20099201019201125201225201329201444201548201655201759201864\\n1st portfolio company \\nsite visit; 1st training \\nfor investment \\nprofessionals; \\n 1st report published \\nto investors\\n20101st Portfolio \\nCompany \\nConference \\nis held, with 24 portfolio \\ncompanies \\nrepresented\\n2011Launch of ESG \\nWebinar Series; \\n RI Committee of \\nLP Advisory Board \\nis formed\\n2012Why has Apollo spent a decade developing what we believe is the most rigorous and \\ndetailed reporting in our industry on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues? \\nBecause Apollo sees that ESG has evolved from a source of risk to a creator of value. \\nAs one of the worlds largest alternative investment \\nmanagers, Apollo believes that consideration of ESG \\nissues is essential to companies success: it enhances \\ntheir ability to manage risks, including regulatory \\nand reputational risks, and identiies areas for cost \\nsavings and for growth. Collecting detailed data and \\nsharing it with portfolio companies and our investment \\nprofessionals better positions them both to improve \\n ESG performance and identify the areas in which \\ncompanies are well-positioned for the future. \\nApollos RI Program is based on three pillars: thorough \\ndiligence of ESG risks, meaningful engagement with \\nportfolio companies post-acquisition, and annual reporting \\nof both quantitative and qualitative ESG metrics. With \\nportfolio companies that collectively employ more than \\n300,000 people, the scale and potential impact of \\nApollos RI Program can be considerable. \\nFor 2018, 64 portfolio companies reported more \\n than 6,000 unique ESG data points. Beyond data, \\n Apollo helps portfolio companies to achieve their \\n own ESG-related goals or targets through engagement, \\nperiodic communication, and by providing them with \\naccess to experts and to each other. Our Portfolio \\nCompany Conference, held every other year, is a central \\nnexus of information exchange across a wide range \\n of ESG issues.\\nApollo irst took note of ESG issues in 2007, formalized \\nour program in 2008, published our irst annual report \\nin 2010, and convened the irst Portfolio Company \\nConference in 2011. In ten years, we have helped \\ndozens of our funds portfolio companies to evolve from \\nanecdotal to inancial-style reporting of ESG data  \\n and to evolve from a compliance and risk view of ESG \\n to seeing a new path to value, as we do. \\nAPOLLOS DECADE \\n OF DRIVING \\n ESG PROGRESS\\n2008Apollo formalizes its \\ncommitment to RI, appoints a Chief RI \\nOicer, and centralizes \\nits RI Program\\n2009Apollo develops \\nand pilots a \\nportfolio company \\nengagement program \\nand endorses the \\nAmerican Investment \\nCouncils \\nGuidelines for Responsible \\nInvesting \\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n2\\n2nd Portfolio \\nCompany \\nConference \\nis held, with 25 portfolio \\ncompanies \\nrepresented\\n20133rd Portfolio \\nCompany Conference \\nis held, with 39 portfolio companies \\nrepresented; analysis \\nof quantitative \\nportfolio company \\n ESG data is published \\nfor the irst time\\n2015Impact Measurement \\nInitiative is \\nlaunched; Apollo becomes irst US-\\n based PE irm to \\nwin Pantheons \\nGP Responsible \\nInvestment Award\\n2014Apollos \\nESG Digest\\n is launched; 100th portfolio \\ncompany is \\nengaged2016201775th portfolio \\ncompany site \\nvisit; 4th Portfolio \\nCompany Conference \\nis held, with 45 portfolio companies \\nrepresented; \\nportfolio company \\nESG data is \\nbenchmarked for \\n the irst time\\n2018Apollos 10th \\nAnnual ESG \\nReport, and \\nirst publicly \\navailable \\n report \\n (July 2019)\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n3\\nportfolio company board \\n meetings in 2018\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n4\\nCorporate Governance \\n and Transparency\\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\nApollo introduced West Corporation to its ESG \\n and compliance reporting process soon after \\nApollo-managed funds acquired the company in \\n2017, helping the telecom to envision a program \\nof ESG excellence. West developed West on the \\nGreen, an ESG-focused team of employees from \\nacross the company. Their initiatives have included \\nmore eicient printing technology, water fountains \\nto decrease plastic bottle use, and an expansion of \\nthe companys recycling program. Apollo also made \\nexperts in risk and compliance available to West, \\nwhich also undertook internal eorts to consolidate \\nand rationalize diverse policies from dierent \\ndepartments. In a major eort, West surveyed every \\nemployee and interviewed more than 80 senior \\nmanagers to identify their concerns, and then \\nbegan to address these issues with the support of \\nthe companys board and executive team. West \\nbelieves that eorts like these make West a better \\nplace to work and a more nimble and resilient \\ncompetitor in its markets. \\n Apollos ESG and compliance reporting is more \\n of a resource than a task. They dont simply measure \\nour performance, they identify experts who help \\nour teams win. Im really proud of the culture of \\ncompliance and environmental awareness that \\n we are building here at West.\\n  \\nNancy Disman, Chief Administrative Oicer \\n and Chief Financial Oicer\\nCase Study\\n West Corporation, \\n Omaha, NEGood corporate governance is the \\nfoundation for sustainable growth, \\neconomic eiciency, and inancial \\nstability. Intangibles such as corporate \\nculture and governance now represent \\nan increasing share of corporate value. \\nRecognizing that good governance \\n drives value, Apollo pays close \\n attention to the governance practices \\n of portfolio companies.\\nOne indicator of a companys commitment to ESG \\nobjectives is its \\nESG oversight:\\n portfolio companies \\nreport to Apollo on their corporate governance policies \\nand related training, frequency of board meetings and \\nattendance, and the frequency with which boards \\nreceive ESG information or reports. Portfolio companies \\ncompliance and risk management practices are \\nalso central to good governance, and portfolio \\ncompanies report on their codes of conduct and \\nvarious governance policies and trainings, including \\nanti-bribery policies, cybersecurity, and data privacy. \\nCorporate accountability also requires \\ntransparency:\\n setting internal goals, establishing processes to achieve \\nthem, and reporting periodically on the companys \\nprogress. Portfolio companies are asked whether they \\nmade ESG information publicly available. Apollo intends \\nto continue these eorts to assist portfolio companies \\nin the pursuit of these governance-related goals. \\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n5\\nSustainable Consumption \\nand Production\\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\nSustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising \\nfuture generations. This often requires transforming how companies produce \\nand what they consume; making more eicient use of resources, capital, and \\ntechnology to reduce economic, environmental, and social risks. Sustainability \\nhas taken its place as a strategic business imperative that can threaten or \\nenhance a companys long-term success.\\nApollos ESG program challenges portfolio companies to understand how they can improve their operations \\nby making consumption and production more eicient and sustainable. Companies report their \\nwater and \\nenergy consumption\\n and relevant reduction initiatives, as well as their \\nwaste production and recycling \\ndata. \\nIn 2018, 97% of portfolio companies reported having waste reduction initiatives and 63% reported recycling \\nwaste. Apollo looks for evidence of disciplined water management and water recycling and reuse, and in \\n2018, 74% of portfolio companies that use water in their operations reported these initiatives in place. \\nPortfolio companies are also asked to disclose how they monitor the sustainability of their \\nsupply chains\\n to \\nreduce both economic and reputational risk. In 2018, 69% of portfolio companies reported having a supplier \\ncode of conduct or a responsible contractor policy in place or in development. Many portfolio companies \\nalso incorporate provisions against child and forced labor in their contracts with suppliers, and conduct site \\nvisits to ensure compliance.\\nVerallia, acquired by Apollo-managed funds in 2015, is one of the worlds leading \\nmanufacturers of glass packaging for food and beverages. As the company strives to \\nprovide healthy and attractive glass packaging, it is proud to be a leader in sustainable \\nconsumption and production. Customers today are looking to suppliers who can help \\nminimize their environmental footprint, making glass an attractive choice for many. \\nIninitely recyclable, glass bottles and jars are collected and recycled to become new food \\ncontainers all over again. Since committing itself to reducing its environmental footprint \\nseveral years ago, Verallia has invested in seven household glass processing centers, \\n and continues its eorts to use as much recycled glass as possible in its furnaces. \\nCase Study\\n Verallia, Courbevoie, France\\n Glass is a 100% recyclable material, and recycled glass (cullet) is a main element in our production. Verallia is committed \\n to using as much recycled glass as possible in its furnaces, to help preserve raw materials and to reduce its CO\\n2 emissions. \\nCullet is a main element in our circular economy scheme and today the availability of cullet is our only limitation.\\n Michel Giannuzzi, Chairman and CEO\\n6\\n7of waste recycled by \\n portfolio companies in 2018\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n7\\nClimate Action\\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\nof portfolio \\ncompanies \\nreported having \\ngreenhouse \\ngas emissions \\nreduction \\ninitiatives\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n8\\nClimate change produces hazards that threaten global \\ninfrastructure, and the health, water, and food security of millions. \\nIn response to a changing climate, public and private institutions \\naround the world, including many inancial institutions, have begun \\nto mobilize. Nearly every major bank has acknowledged climate-\\nrelated risks and articulated commitments to address those risks. \\nIn April 2019, the Network for Greening the Financial System  a \\ncoalition of 34 central banks and supervisors  published a report \\nconcluding that climate-related risks are a source of inancial \\nrisk, and airmed their collective responsibility to ensure that the \\ninancial system is resilient in the face of these risks.\\nApollo was one of the irst investment managers to require portfolio companies to report \\ntheir greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\\n on an annual basis, and continues to encourage \\nportfolio companies to understand relevant \\nclimate-related risks\\n. Apollo also asks portfolio \\ncompanies to report on \\nenergy and fuel consumption and cost\\n, on reduction programs, \\nand on the goals or targets they achieved. Apollo also facilitates an annual GHG emission \\ncalculation webinar, where climate experts engage with portfolio companies to help \\nidentify and calculate their GHG emissions, then provide them with industry-speciic \\nresources to better understand their climate-related risks. \\nAcquired by Apollo-managed funds in 2018, Sun Country Airlines has set a goal to reduce its fuel \\nconsumption by 736,000 gallons in 2019. The companys 14 new technological and business \\ninitiatives to achieve that goal have already begun to show results: from Q1 2018 to Q1 2019, the \\nairline reduced its gallons per passenger by 12%. Removing redundant ovens and coee makers from \\nplanes, and installing new, lightweight seats, has cut aircraft weight  the primary driver of fuel \\nburn  while new software and procedures, such as using only one engine while taxiing, have also \\ncontributed to savings. The airlines Soaring to Sustainability initiative aims for zero waste, including \\nwaste collected on aircraft. Through partnerships with local governments, a company-wide recycling \\nprogram, and employee awareness training, Sun Country has diverted more than 300,000 lbs. of \\nwaste to recycling while simultaneously reducing fees and taxes related to waste removal. \\nCase Study\\n Sun Country Airlines, \\n Eagan, MN Sun Country has made great strides in recent years, but \\nthere is much to be done as we seek to be the best stewards \\nof our natural resources. I am excited about our future and \\nour dedicated employees eorts in this area.\\n Jude Bricker, President and CEO\\n2018 ESG SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT\\n9\\nWhen employees are engaged with their \\nwork and their organizations, both they \\nand their companies beneit. Studies have \\nshown that teams with higher employee \\nengagement enjoy lower costs, increased \\nproits, and a safer workforce and \\ngenerally outperform their peers: Gallup \\nreports that work units in the top quartile \\nin employee engagement outperform \\nwork units in the bottom quartile by 10% \\non customer ratings, 22% in proitability, \\nand 21% in productivity. Work units in the \\ntop quartile also reported signiicantly \\nlower turnover rates and fewer safety \\nincidents and quality defects.\\nSince the beginning of its ESG Reporting Program, \\n Apollo has recognized the inherent links between \\nemployee engagement, safety, and company \\nperformance. Among other metrics, portfolio companies \\nreport quantitative data including \\nvoluntary turnover\\n and total incident and lost time rates\\n. Apollo also asks \\ncompanies to submit qualitative descriptions of their \\nemployee engagement and diversity initiatives\\n because, \\nwhen properly executed, these yield beneits like \\nincreased productivity and lower employee turnover, \\n and help companies retain and attract top talent. \\nRespect for Workers\\nTHE ESG OPPORTUNITY\\nPhoenix Services, acquired by Apollo-managed funds in 2018, \\nrecently launched a Safety Starts With Us initiative as part \\nof its Zero Harm strategy. The new initiative aims to engage \\nsupervisors and employees and provide them with resources \\nto become safety advocates at their facilities. By creating \\nsafety leaders at all levels, Phoenix has improved its safety \\nculture and brought the company closer to its goal of Zero \\nHarm. In 2018, the company launched a mobile app for event \\nreporting and employee observations. Health and safety data \\nfrom 38 facilities across nine countries on ive continents is \\nnow gathered centrally in real time. Phoenix uses this data at \\nthe facility, regional, and global levels to identify hazard trends, \\nrecognize potentially serious events, and tailor strategies to \\nreduce risk. These eorts contributed to a 54% reduction in the \\ncompanys total recordable injury rate over the last four years, \\nmaking Phoenix a safety leader in the steel services industry.\\n Using technology and data analytics to drive our \\nEHS strategy has been a game-changer for Phoenix \\nServices.

Across sectors, \\ncompanies are utilizing a variety of tools to meet these challenges: investing \\nmoney, providing services and technical assistance, deploying human \\ncapital, and developing products and services that have a positive impact. \\nResponsible citizenship eorts are often tied to business strategies that \\nprioritize social and environmental goals that are aligned with sustainable \\nbusiness operations. Many companies now recognize that acting responsibly \\nmakes good business sense and is essential to their future prosperity. \\nApollos ESG Reporting Program seeks to measure and encourage responsible citizenship eorts at \\nportfolio companies. In 2018, portfolio companies reported on more than a dozen quantitative and \\nqualitative metrics designed to capture a variety of programs and initiatives, \\nincluding philanthropic \\ngiving, payment of state and local taxes, volunteer eorts, community outreach, customer \\nsatisfaction,\\n and product quality and safety\\n. Apollo also asks portfolio companies to identify any \\nproducts or services that generate a positive social or environmental impact,\\n and many do  in \\neducation, job search, healthcare, nutrition, and more.\\nThe employees of Rackspace, a leader in managed cloud computing that was acquired by Apollo-managed \\nfunds in 2016, serve not only their customers but also their communities around the globe.

Rack Gives Back, the companys employee-led volunteer program, connects Rackers with \\nopportunities to share their time and talent  whether mentoring in schools, leading food drives, or rebuilding \\nafter natural disasters. Rackspace supports employee service with up to 24 hours of annual paid volunteer \\ntime, and in 2018, Rackers volunteered more than 27,000 hours for local nonproits.

This understanding is core to our approach to sustainable \\nnance, which is grounded in two key pillars  inclusive growth and climate transition  that we apply to our work with \\nclients and our business.At the same time that the business case for sustainable growth has crystallized, the consequences of inaction have also \\nbecome more apparent. This is a rare moment where the pull of opportunity, and the push of risk, are driving market \\nparticipants in the same direction, toward sustainable growth.\\nWhile we have been engaged in sustainable nance for the better part of two decades, 2019 represents a notable surge \\n in momentum. During the year, we announced the formation of the Sustainable Finance Group to drive our efforts across \\n our businesses. Our ambitions in this area are sizable. We have set a target of $750 billion in nancing, advisory and \\ninvesting activity over the next 10 years across these themes of climate transition and inclusive growth. As signicantly, \\n we are weaving these capabilities across the rm, encompassing both how our divisions serve our clients and how we \\nmanage ourselves as an organization. \\nSustainable nance was front and center across our client interactions in 2019. We will go deeper into several examples \\n in the pages that follow, but a few examples are worth highlighting here. We worked with Enel to issue the rst-ever general \\ncorporate purpose bond that links the payment of its coupon to the companys goal of generating at least 55 percent of its \\npower from renewables by the end of 2021. We created a new corporate cash management solution that prioritizes business \\nwith diverse broker-dealers. And we established a new policy to only take public those companies in the US and Europe with \\nat least one diverse board director (starting next year, we will increase our target to two). We also continued to deepen the \\nintegration of sustainable nance within our core work, from how we make and manage private equity investments, to how \\nwe steward assets as an active shareholder. Sustainable nance has been a powerful application of our One Goldman Sachs \\napproach  mobilizing our best thinking across the rm on central questions for some of our largest clients. \\nThis report arrives in the midst of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has already \\nhad a devastating impact on societies around the world. We have seen historic \\nlevels of jobless claims, record volatility in the markets, and unprecedented \\ndisruption to all aspects of our day-to-day lives. While so much remains \\nuncertain about the course of the virus, what is clear is that we will be dealing \\nwith its effects for many months, and likely much longer. \\nFELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,(from left to right)John E. Waldron \\n President and Chief Operating OfcerDavid M. Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive OfcerStephen M. Scherr Chief Financial Ofcer\\n4Our views on climate and inclusive economic growth also manifest in how we manage our own rm. That starts with \\nour support of our people and extends to fostering an inclusive environment where all of our colleagues can achieve \\ntheir goals. In 2019, we adopted new policies to drive diverse hiring at all seniority levels and to support working parents, \\nincluding by increasing parental leave to 20 weeks for all employees. Through these initiatives, we are reafrming our \\nbelief that diversity and inclusion are critical to the long-term success of Goldman Sachs.\\nManaging the rm sustainably also means a continued focus on the efciency of our operations, taking care to reduce \\nour environmental impact over time. In the past year, we opened new talent hubs in London and Bengaluru that include \\nbest-in-class sustainability features, and we are well on our way to our 2020 goal of achieving green-building certications \\nfor 70 percent of our global real estate portfolio.\\nGoing forward, we will continue to pursue innovation and progress on issues related to sustainable growth. With all that \\nis happening around us, we recognize that the path forward may not be linear, but we are committed to this work for the \\nlong-term benet of our clients, our stakeholders and broader society.\\nDavid M.

By leveraging our commercial expertise to \\ncatalyze market-driven solutions, Goldman Sachs is committed to helping our clients and stakeholders accelerate \\n the transition to a low-carbon economy in an inclusive and orderly way.\\nOur approach to climate change encompasses a holistic view of commercial solutions to mitigate climate risk \\nand capture opportunities that promote environmental progress across growth areas in clean energy, sustainable \\ntransport, food and agriculture, waste and materials, and ecosystem services. Through innovative approaches to \\nclimate, combined with our deep market expertise across these themes, we are at the forefront of advising clients \\n on their climate transition strategies, thereby helping markets and economies capture sustainable growth. \\n\\n11Despite advancing efforts on many \\nfronts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, \\nclimate impacts will be unavoidable. \\n As a result, an equal emphasis needs to be \\nplaced on climate resiliency and adaptation, \\nwhich is the focus of a $700 million \\nbond issuance by the European Bank for \\nReconstruction and Development (EBRD). \\nGoldman Sachs has been at the forefront \\nin developing catastrophe bonds, which are \\ndebt instruments designed to raise money \\nin the event of natural disasters, including \\nfrom extreme weather events. From there, \\nit was a natural step to the development \\nof the rst resiliency bond, a new category \\nof green bond based on a set of climate resilience principles established by the \\nClimate Bonds Initiative, an international \\norganization that is mobilizing the bond market to support a low-carbon and climate-\\nresilient economy.\\nThe offering is an outgrowth of a 2018 \\nClimate Bonds Initiative meeting that \\nbrought together experts in resilience and \\nclimate adaptation. As a result, principles \\naround these issues were added to existing \\nstandards and certication criteria, which \\nthe Initiative had been applying to green \\nbonds since 2015. Goldman Sachs served \\non the advisory board and helped develop \\nthe principles.Goldman Sachs has been a leader in the development of innovative nancing approaches that drive capital \\ntoward green and social projects. The past years activity had a number of notable rsts, including those that \\nprovide new solutions that can be scaled across the market.\\nWorking with Enel, an Italian-headquartered energy company,\\n Goldman Sachs structured the rst sustainability performance bond linked to the United \\nNations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rather than restrict the use \\n of proceeds to specic green projects, the bond ties Enels cost of capital to \\n its strategic commitment to make installed capacity 55% renewable by the end \\nof 2021  core to the companys broader decarbonization strategy, including \\nits long-term goal of net-zero emissions. Under the bonds performance-based \\ncovenant, investors receive a step up in interest rates if the target is not met. \\nIssued in September 2019, Enels $1.5 billion inaugural SDG-linked bond was \\npreceded by robust discussions with investors on the innovative structure, \\nand followed in October by a 2.5 billion similar offering. Enel has operations \\nin 33 countries on ve continents. It manages 46 gigawatts of capacity from \\nrenewable sources and supplies 70 million customers worldwide. \\nINNOVATIVE APPROACH \\n TO FINANCING CLIMATE TRANSITION\\nFIRST BOND BASED ON \\nCLIMATE\\n RESILIENCE \\nTHE FIRST SDG\\n-LINKED BOND\\n12Innovative Approach to Financing Climate Transition\\n (continued)The mission of The Conservation Fund is to accelerate land conservation in ways that make \\nboth environmental and economic sense. \\nThe Conservation Fund was formed in 1985 to help \\npublic agencies and local communities in the United States achieve permanent protection of land \\nand water resources with interim capital and technical expertise. \\nIn 2019, Goldman Sachs helped issue a $150 million green bond for The Conservation Fund  the \\nrst such nonprot to issue a green bond to solely fund permanent land conservation. The proceeds \\nwill be dedicated to scaling efforts to protect some 5 million acres of the nations working forests, \\nmitigating climate change, protecting ecosystems and strengthening rural communities.\\nFIRST GREEN \\nBOND FOR US \\nCONSERVATION\\nGoldman Sachs facilitated climate-focused green \\n and sustainability bond issuances for two of the largest \\ncompanies in the world  PepsiCo and Sysco. \\nPepsiCos rst-ever green bond aims to support \\ndecarbonizing the companys global operations and supply \\nchain and investing in advanced packaging and water \\nsustainability. The $1 billion issuance that we helped \\nunderwrite in 2019 drew strong market support, with \\ngrowing investor interest in ESG-linked securities. PepsiCo \\nintends to use the proceeds to pursue a wide range  of initiatives, including greater use of renewable energy, \\n water replenishment in high-water-risk regions, and \\ninvestments in sustainable product packaging.\\nSysco, the international food distributor, became \\n the second US company to issue a sustainability \\n bond, which allocates proceeds to both green and \\nsocial projects. In February 2020, we structured \\n a $1 billion issuance for Sysco, which included \\n $500 million in sustainability bonds. The sustainability \\nbond portion will support a wide range of initiatives, \\nincluding procurement of sustainably harvested \\n food, investments in more sustainable water \\nmanagement, and sourcing clean energy, as the \\ncompany seeks to use renewable sources through \\nlong-term power purchase agreements for a portion \\n of its energy needs. INAUGURAL ISSUERS \\n THAT SCALE THE MARKET\\n\\n13Innovative Approach to Financing Climate Transition\\n (continued)FIRST HYBRID GREEN \\nNOTE BY LATIN AMERICAN \\nCOMPANY \\nFIRST GREEN \\n EUROPEAN CMBSIn October 2019, AES Gener, an electricity \\n generator in Chile, Argentina and Colombia,\\n issued \\n a $450 million green bond with Goldman Sachs \\n help  the rst green hybrid security in Latin America. \\nAES Gener will use the proceeds to continue the transition to a more sustainable energy matrix by \\nincreasing its base of renewable power projects.\\nAES Gener is making this transition according to  its Greentegra strategy, with the goal of becoming \\nSouth Americas energy supplier of choice by \\ndecarbonizing its customers electric supply through \\nlong-term renewable power purchasing agreements \\nand reducing the carbon intensity of its portfolio. \\n This includes aggressive development of a wide \\n range of renewable energy projects, including \\n hydro, wind, solar and advanced battery energy \\nstorage technology.\\nIn 2019, we created the rst Green European \\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Security\\n   River Green Finance 2020  a green bond \\nthat enables companies to tap capital markets \\nbased on the sustainable aspects of their \\ncollateral. In this case, the asset is River \\nOuest, a 690,000-square-foot ofce building \\nin the western suburbs of Paris with a very \\ngood rating from BREEAM, a sustainability \\nassessment method for rating buildings, \\ninfrastructure and master planning projects. The \\n186 million mortgage-backed issuance gives \\nasset managers the opportunity to invest in \\n a securitized product with green collateral.\\n\\n14Brightmark is a San Franciscobased global waste \\n solutions provider whose projects include turning \\nplastic waste into transport fuels and other useful \\nproducts.\\n Through a $185 million nancing Goldman Sachs \\nfacilitated, Brightmark is building and plans to operate a \\nnew Plastics Renewal plant in Ashley, Indiana, that will turn \\n100,000 tons of scrap plastic into 18 million gallons of \\n ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, naphtha blend stocks and nearly \\n6 million gallons of commercial-grade wax. The company \\nwill employ the process of pyrolysis, or plastics renewal, \\nwhich uses heating to decompose post-use plastic in \\n an environment with limited oxygen. This process is seen \\nas a key solution to both reducing petrochemical production \\nand plastic waste in markets around the world. \\nBig River Steel, an advanced recycler and steelmaker \\n in northeast Arkansas,\\n and the rst steel producer in  the US that is LEED-certied, will use a $487 million \\nindustrial bond offering structured by Goldman Sachs to \\nexpand scrap metal recycling and production of at-rolled \\nsteel. This will set the stage for downstream investment, \\nincluding the production of higher-grade electrical steel, \\ndemand for which is expected to grow as electric-vehicle \\nproduction ramps up. Big River Steels Flex Mill technology, \\nalong with its focus on machine learning and data analytics, \\nallows it to produce some of the most demanding steel \\ngrades at a competitive cost.\\nExpansion of recycling and reuse is among the most important ways to ght climate change by limiting \\ndependence on new materials and reducing waste. Whether through capital raising or direct investment, we \\nhave helped drive the circular economy by enabling companies involved to innovate and scale operations.\\nDEPLOYING CAPITAL \\n TO ADVANCE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\n15We saw an under-addressed \\n market opportunity in small and mid-\\n sized commercial and industrial solar  \\n helping companies, cities, schools and hospitals \\ninstall solar on their rooftops. Based on our \\nassessment, the opportunity was a good t for \\n our rms network of relationships, expertise in \\n risk management in energy markets, and strength \\n in evaluating and managing credit risk. From that \\nfoundation, we formed the GSAM Renewable \\n Power Group, a team of roughly 35 experienced \\nprofessionals that invests in renewable energy \\nassets. This model allows us to partner with clients \\n to own and manage projects across the United \\nStates that deliver clean energy, and in turn, to \\n sell the power produced by these assets under \\n long-term agreements to energy users. Currently, the GSAM Renewable Power Group \\n is among the largest owners and operators of \\ndistributed renewable generation assets in the United \\nStates with over 1 gigawatt of operating capacity. The \\nGroup currently manages equity capital of approximately \\n$1.9 billion, and expects to deploy approximately \\n $4 billion of total capital, including $500 million from \\n a green bond offering in December 2019. \\nThe GSAM Renewable Power Group partnered with \\none of the largest solar developers, SunPower, to build \\nNew York Citys largest solar project at JFK Airport. \\nOnce completed, the project will allow surrounding \\ncommunities to access solar energy at reduced rates. Besides reducing JFKs greenhouse gas emissions \\n by approximately 7,000 tons annually (equivalent \\n to taking about 1,400 cars off the road), the project is \\nexpected to lower the Port Authoritys greenhouse gas \\nemissions at the airport by around 10 percent The \\nGSAM Renewable Power Group will hold the power \\npurchase agreement for the project, while SunPower \\nwill develop and construct the infrastructure at JFK. \\nINVESTING TO SCALE \\n CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES \\n FUELING GROWTH IN \\n DISTRIBUTED POWER \\nIn 2019, a fund managed by our Merchant Bank, alongside Volkswagen Group and BMW, \\n led a $1 billion equity capital raise for Northvolt, a Swedish supplier of sustainable, high-quality \\nlithium-ion battery cells and systems manufactured for the automotive, industrial and energy \\nstorage sectors.\\n The capital raise underpinned the nancing of the rst 16 GWh of Northvolts rst \\ngigafactory, which will be powered by 100% renewable electricity with plans for a co-located battery \\nrecycling facility, which will deliver the worlds greenest lithium-ion battery with a minimal CO\\n2 footprint. \\nFurther supporting the equity nancing and subsequent debt nancing process, Northvolt \\nsigned a number of supply agreements with a combined order value over $13 billion through \\n2030. In addition to the Swedish primary facility, Northvolt also formed a joint venture with \\nthe Volkswagen Group to establish a 16 GWh battery cell gigafactory in Germany, which \\n will bring Volkswagens total investment in Northvolt to around $1 billion.\\nPOWERING A REVOLUTION IN BATTERY TECH\\n\\n16Twiga Foods is a Kenyan end-to-end distributor of fresh and processed food.\\n Through Goldman \\n Sachs investment in the company, Twiga Foods is developing proprietary technology and logistical assets \\nto support its distribution system, which enables improved sustainability of the food and agriculture value \\nchain and allows farmers to be paid within 48 hours via mobile platforms. The investment is laying the \\ngroundwork for expansion to cities across Africa, helping to drive sustainable access to lower-cost, \\n higher-quality food and improved economic security for farmers.\\nSUSTAINABLE \\nFOOD AND AGRICULTURE\\nFEEDING THE PLANET \\nSUSTAINABLY \\nDRIVING FOOD SECURITYAmid a growing focus on human health, climate change, resource \\nconservation and animal welfare, \\nGoldman Sachs led the $277 million IPO \\n of Beyond Meat. Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in \\n the United States offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. Founded \\nin 2009, Beyond Meat has a mission of building meat directly from plants, an \\ninnovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other \\nsensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying \\n the nutritional and environmental benets of eating its plant-based meat \\n products. As of December 31, 2019, Beyond Meats portfolio of fresh and \\n frozen plant-based proteins was sold at approximately 77,000 retail, restaurant \\n and foodservice outlets in more than 65 countries worldwide.\\n\\n17DIFFERENTIATED \\nESG \\nINVESTING STRATEGIES\\nExpanding the Opportunities  \\nESG and impact investments continue to gain momentum driven by rapidly \\nrising demand from institutional and individual investors. We continue to develop our capabilities in delivering \\ninnovative and differentiated investment strategies, including those focused on renewable energy and \\ndecarbonization. At GSAM, ESG assets under supervision increased from $17 billion in December 2018 to \\n $74 billion in December 2019. \\nIn 2019, GSAM raised assets for an equity strategy that invests in companies focused on environmental \\nimpact, with themes that range from renewable energy  \\nincluding solar, wind, bioenergy and smart grid \\nservices  to electric and autonomous vehicles and sustainable food production. \\nThe strategy assumes that, in ghting climate change, government-led approaches will undershoot key targets  \\nand that private sector innovation will be critical to meeting the climate challenge. It also assumes that companies \\nthat successfully provide new solutions have signicant upside, and that institutional and individual investors \\nseek the opportunity to take part in that potential. \\nThe strategy leverages our deep experience in ESG investment and our proprietary approach to weighing ESG \\nfactors, risks and opportunities.\\nRecognizing that environmental factors\\n can affect investment \\nperformance and represent potential investment risk, GSAM has prioritized \\nengagement on climate change-related issues, including environmental \\ndisclosure, climate risk and carbon reduction commitments. For example, \\nin 2019, the GSAM Global Stewardship Team had ongoing engagement \\nwith a Japanese railway company, which resulted in enhanced internal \\nESG oversight and improved disclosure.\\nFUNDAMENTAL \\nEQUITY \\n STRATEGY \\nCLIMATE CHANGE \\nENGAGEMENT Low-carbon passive equity portfolio Climate risk framework Stewardship / Engagement\\n Operational Efciency Climate-focused private market investments Thematic public equity investmentsPROBABILITY DENSITY\\nRETURNSKey Potential Value Drivers\\nImplementation options across asset classesFor illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as research, investment advice or a recommendation.

Benchmarked to the \\nRussell 1000 index, the strategy relies on a carbon \\nemissions metric, developed jointly with the Fund, that \\ntakes into account Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions  \\nthose produced directly by the burning of fossil fuels \\n and indirectly by consuming electrical power.\\nThe San Francisco Employees Retirement System \\n(SFERS) sought to reduce its carbon footprint as \\npart of a broad strategy to address climate risk and \\nopportunities.\\n GSAM enabled SFERS to develop a \\nframework for a multifaceted approach grounded in \\n the view that some oil & gas companies are better \\npositioned than others for the transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy. The framework enables identication of high-\\nrisk fossil fuel assets, establishes a plan for engagement \\nwhere possible, and outlines options for targeted and \\nphased disinvestment of assets where there may be a \\nhigh unmitigated risk.Differentiated ESG Investing Strategies (continued)GSAM was an anchor investor \\nand partner in the Renewable \\nResources Groups Sustainable \\nWater Impact Fund (SWIF).\\n Through \\nclient commitments, GSAM was \\nable to provide over $300 million of \\nthe SWIFs $900+ million fundraise. \\nRenewable Resources Group \\nlaunched SWIF in partnership with \\nThe Nature Conservancy to invest in \\nportfolio companies that will improve \\nthe management of surface water, \\ngroundwater and farms to more \\nsustainably meet the water supply \\nneeds of people, the environment and \\nthe agricultural economy.

In February 2020, Goldman Sachs joined as a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), a policy organization representing the broadest coalition on climate in the US supporting a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend plan as a pragmatic and efcient solution for reducing GHG emissions and addressing climate change. In December 2019, our CEO David Solomon also published an editorial that underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and sustainable growth and called for governments to put a price on the cost of carbon. Carbonomics, a report issued in December by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, analyzes the cost curve of decarbonization through almost 100 different technologies. The report identies an abundance  of large, low-cost investment opportunities in power generation, industry, \\ntransport, buildings and nature-based solutions that can support  $12 trillion dollars of decarbonization investments annually, creating \\n new jobs, higher energy security and lower pollution. Reducing net  carbon emissions quickly and effectively will demand a combination of carbon pricing, technology and CO2 sequestration. The report describes  how capital markets already play a leading role by nancing the energy transition while reducing investments in hydrocarbon development, fostering consolidation in a new age of restraint for the hydrocarbon industry, and the evolution of large companies from Big Oil to Big Energy \\nas they become broader, cleaner energy providers.\\nCarbon Pricing:\\nA Market-Oriented Emissions \\nReduction Strategy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20In addition to our work with clients, we continue to inform broader market approaches by leveraging \\nour insights through thought leadership and partnerships.ADVANCING \\nTHE ECOSYSTEM\\nUnderpinning the potential for broader scale and impact across inclusive growth and climate \\ntransition themes is a need for good data. \\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is \\npartnering with corporates and investors alike to drive the adoption of nancially material, market-informed \\ndata that is industry specic. Goldman Sachs was the rst major US nancial institution and the rst global \\ninvestment bank to report under SASB standards in 2019 and GSAM is a long-standing member of the \\nSASB Alliance and SASBs Investor Advisory Group.\\nIn 2019, GSAM teamed up\\n with a select group of other leading asset managers to advance climate-\\nrelated investment among national sovereign wealth \\nfunds (SWFs). Known as the One Planet Asset \\nManagers Initiative, this collaboration supports \\nthe efforts of the One Planet SWF Working Group, \\ncomposed of leading SWFs, to drive a deeper \\nconsideration of the impact of climate change on \\ninvestment portfolios. We believe that, while more \\nSWFs are incorporating sustainability into their \\nportfolios, broadening sets of investment options and \\napproaches can accelerate the trend, further bridging \\nthe gap between policy and portfolio objectives.\\nIn January 2019, Goldman Sachs joined the CEO-led Climate Finance \\nLeadership Initiative (CFLI)\\n as one of seven founding members alongside Allianz, \\nAXA, ENEL, GPIF, HSBC and Macquarie. CFLI was established by Michael R. \\nBloomberg, in his capacity as the UN Secretary-Generals Special Envoy for Climate \\nAction, to support greater mobilization of climate nance ows around the world. In \\nSeptember 2019, CFLI delivered the \\nFinancing the Low-Carbon Future\\n report to the \\nUN, outlining ways to further mobilize private climate nance at the scale and speed \\nneeded to support a rapid and orderly transition to a low-carbon global economy.\\nQUANTIFYING IMPACT \\n AND PERFORMANCE \\nPARTNERING WITH \\nASSET OWNERSSCALING \\n CLIMATE \\n FINANCE\\nINCLUSIVE GROWTHIt is imperative that the global economy generate growth that is more inclusive\\n  that enables  people to contribute to society, expands the middle class, and helps businesses and communities grow. \\n Our rm is focused on driving a range of inclusive growth opportunities, spanning innovative nancial \\nproducts and services that reach more people, expanded access to education and healthcare, as well as \\ngreater investment in housing and infrastructure development in underserved communities. \\nAt its core, our approach to inclusive growth draws upon innovative ideas that mitigate unequal access, \\nincrease affordability and improve quality.

According to Credijusto, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up \\n 99 percent of businesses and account for 74 percent of the countrys total employment. Despite this, SMEs receive only 15 percent \\nof outstanding credit, with banks rejecting over 80 percent of loan applications from such businesses. In addition, even when credit \\n is available, the lending process is lengthy, with waits of up to six months for loans that often have high interest rates.\\nGoldman Sachs also led a funding round for ZestMoney, an Indian ntech startup that lends to millions who lack traditional credit. \\nZestMoney enables consumers to secure loans and make online purchases while building a credit history that opens doors \\n to traditional credit markets. ZestMoney uses mobile technology, digital banking and articial intelligence to extend credit amounts \\nof $140 to $3,000 and enable users to pay back in manageable installments. To date, ZestMoney is accepted by more than 3,000 \\nmerchants, including Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm.

Goldman Sachs Urban \\nInvestment Group (UIG), an investor in community \\n and economic development, provided a $50 million loan \\nfacility to Climb.\\nIn addition, UIG made a commitment of up to \\n$10 million to On the Road Lending,\\n a Community \\nDevelopment Financial Institution loan fund that provides \\nlow-interest loans for purchasing reliable fuel-efcient \\ncars. The company focuses on underserved markets \\nthroughout the Southeast, where mass transit is largely unavailable, car transport is essential, and low-income \\nindividuals are vulnerable to predatory lending practices. \\nThis service helps reduce poverty in these areas by \\nincreasing access to quality jobs, affordable health care \\nand fresh food.\\nCLOSING THE \\n CREDIT GAP \\nSUPPORTING \\n JOB GROWTH\\n23Marcus, Goldman Sachs Consumer business, was created to help consumers achieve nancial well-\\n being. \\nCore to this philosophy is a commitment to value, transparency and simplicity, which includes providing \\n no-fee personal loans, valuable savings products, and an intuitive digital experience, alongside access to tools and \\nresources that can help increase nancial empowerment and literacy. These include savings and loan calculators \\n and educational content focused on savings, budgeting, smart use of credit and long-term nancial planning. This \\ncontent covers a wide range of nancial topics, from building and maintaining an emergency fund, to understanding \\nhow 529 education plans work, to strategizing for empty-nesters. \\nIn addition, in 2019 we partnered with Apple to launch a no-fee credit card that incorporates new levels of privacy, \\nsecurity and transparency, and provides tools that make it easy to analyze spending patterns over time and show \\ncustomers how to save on interest.\\nSince its launch in 2016, the Consumer business platform has attracted 5 million customers, with $7 billion in \\n loans and credit card balances and $60 billion in total deposits. In 2019, the Marcus loan program scored highest \\nin J.D. Powers Personal Loan Customer Satisfaction Study, which gauged consumer satisfaction across four key \\nmetrics: application and approval process, billing and payments, customer interaction, and loans and terms.\\nCOVID-19 Support\\n Marcus has helped provide relief to consumers facing unexpected hardship through its customer assistance \\nprogram. During recent natural disasters  including hurricanes and last years California wildres  this program \\nsupported consumers as they recovered, allowing them to postpone loan payments without being charged interest. \\nIn 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges, we are focused on helping consumers through \\nMarcus and Apple Card  allowing customers to postpone two monthly payments without accruing interest, and \\nhave early access to funds in CDs with no early withdrawal penalties. \\nCREATING A CONSUMER HUB FOR FINANCIAL \\nEMPOWERMENT AND LITERACY \\nDriving Financial Inclusion (continued)\\n24ADVANCING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION \\n  A COMMERCIAL IMPERATIVE\\nResearch shows that companies that have a top \\nquartile ranking as it relates to ethnic diversity \\n of their management team \\nare 33 percent more likely to have industry-leading protability  and \\nthat companies ranked in the top quartile for gender \\ndiversity of their management team are 21 percent \\nmore likely to outperform peers.\\n1Yet, despite this evidence, just 3 percent of US \\nventure capital goes to women-led teams, while a \\nmere 1 percent goes to black and Latinx founders. Mirroring this imbalance, lack of diversity is pronounced among venture \\n capital and private equity rms. Although diverse-owned rms are overrepresented in the top quartile of private equity groups, \\ndiverse asset managers have less than 1.3 percent of the $69 trillion of global assets under management.\\n2This imbalance is the impetus behind \\nLaunch With GS\\n, a $500 million investment strategy grounded in our belief that diverse \\nteams drive strong returns. \\nLaunch With GS\\n seeks to increase access to capital for women, black, Latinx, and other diverse \\nentrepreneurs and investors. Since its inception, Goldman Sachs has deployed more than $230 million to businesses with \\n diverse management teams globally  from a software provider in Atlanta, to a ntech company in Bengaluru and a pediatric \\nclinic in China. In early 2020, Launch With GS\\n announced Goldman Sachs rst Black and Latinx Entrepreneur Cohort, which will be comprised \\n of a group of high-growth startups from across the United States. Beyond access to capital, these businesses will participate \\nin an eight-week virtual, customized experience that will include one-on-one and sector-specic workshops with our research, \\nbanking and investment teams and interaction with startup experts across key areas including legal services, capitalization, \\nmarketing and branding. Members of the Cohort will engage with the Goldman Sachs network, as well as the \\nLaunch With \\nGS Advisory Council, composed of leading entrepreneurs, investors and executives. The program will culminate in an Investor \\nShowcase, where entrepreneurs will introduce their companies to an invitation-only investor audience. \\nLEVERAGING THE \\nSTRENGTHS OF DIVERSE \\nENTREPRENEURSHIPWe believe that diversity, in addition to being a social imperative, is also just good business. Increased diversity of \\nexperience, gender identity, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation reduces the risk of groupthink and unlocks creative \\nand impactful solutions. This is why we are committed to driving diversity in our work with clients and have prioritized \\nhaving a diverse and inclusive workforce  including ambitious diversity goals for recruitment and hiring.\\n1 McKinsey, 2018. \\n2 Knight Foundation, 2019.\\n\\n25INCREASED FOCUS ON \\n BOARD DIVERSITYDRIVING BOARD DIVERSITY \\n AT THE STARTING GATE\\nAdvancing Diversity and Inclusion  A Commercial Imperative (continued)Underscoring our conviction that diverse perspectives can have \\n a strong impact on company performance,\\n we have prioritized board \\ndiversity in our stewardship efforts. During the 2019 proxy season, \\n GSAM voted against 312 directors at 214 companies for lacking at \\nleast one woman on the board. In November 2019, GSAM contacted \\napproximately 50 companies in situations where votes were cast \\nagainst board members for lack of female representation. Through these \\nengagements, we sought information on each companys approach to \\nrecruiting diverse talent and the potential barriers to such recruitment. \\nAs an additional example of these efforts, GSAM made engagement \\non board diversity a key feature in repositioning an $11 billion European \\nmoney market fund under its management. The fund, which also employs \\nan ESG alignment approach across various factors, has a dedicated \\nengagement focus with respect to board diversity. To encourage diversity, \\nthe GSAM Stewardship Team assesses, engages and tracks progress in \\nportfolio companies with an underrepresentation of women on the board.\\nIn 2018, when GSAM\\n repositioned a money market fund focused on the \\npurchase of US government securities, \\nincluding treasuries and agencies, the purpose was to drive diversity by \\ndirecting the funds trades, subject to \\nbest execution, to diverse broker-dealers. \\nOn average, during 2019, the fund used \\ndiverse broker-dealers to buy approximately \\nhalf of its assets, simultaneously helping \\nthese dealers to grow and enabling clients \\nto add a diversity-focused investment \\nsolution to their portfolios.\\nIn 2019, the fund reached $1.5 billion \\n in assets, drawing high-prole investors, \\nincluding one of Americas most prominent \\ncompanies: JetBlue. JetBlue was among \\nthe rst clients to join the repurposed fund, leveraging it as a vehicle to expand \\nopportunities for underrepresented rms. \\nFurther underscoring our commitment to advancing diversity, we \\nannounced that, effective July 2020, we will only underwrite IPOs \\nof companies domiciled in the US and Western Europe that have at \\nleast one diverse board member. \\nWe will raise this target to two during \\n2021. We strongly believe in the business case for diversity and that \\nhaving diverse perspectives on boards leads to better governance and \\nstronger company performance for our corporate clients.\\nWhile we dene diversity across multiple dimensions, one example \\n our CEO David Solomon cited as part of the announcement is that \\n the performance of public offerings of US companies with at least one \\nfemale director has signicantly outperformed companies with no \\n female directors over the past four years. \\nIt is our responsibility as an advisor supporting our IPO clients to ensure \\nthat their governance structure is setting them up for long-term success, \\nparticularly as they transition to the public markets for the rst time. \\n We are actively working with our clients to help them achieve and \\nsurpass these diversity targets by facilitating access to our extensive \\nnetwork of diverse board candidates, which encompasses individuals \\nrepresenting a broad denition of diversity, such as race, gender, \\nethnicity and sexual orientation.\\nBOOSTING ACCESS TO \\n DIVERSE BROKER-DEALERS\\n26As one of the most expensive housing markets in the country,\\n New York City has strong \\ndemand for affordable units at a time when 44 percent of all households are rent-burdened \\n(dened as spending more than 30 percent of income on rent), and more than half of those are \\nseverely rent-burdened  spending more than 50 percent. In 2019, we provided $88 million \\nin nancing for South Point at Hunters Point South in Long Island City, NY, which is part of the \\nbroader Hunters Point South, the largest affordable housing development created in New York \\nCity since the 1970s. South Point consists of 1,132 units of mixed-income housing across two \\nbuildings with 849 permanently affordable housing units for families earning between $32,000 \\nand $128,000 a year. \\nIn addition, the project will be Enterprise Green Communitycertied, using low-emissivity glass, \\nexhaust heat recovery systems, low-ow plumbing xtures, and a water-sourced heat pump to \\nachieve 15 percent greater energy efciency than required by the city code.\\nIn the Pacic Northwest, we made a private investment in and are providing a debt facility \\nto Sustainable Living Partners (SLP), a real estate technology venture aimed at sustainable, \\naffordable multifamily housing using a prefabricated building technology with a distinctly \\ngreen prole. SLP is the result of a joint venture between Sustainable Living Innovations \\n(SLI) of Seattle and Renova Capital Partners, a private equity rm specializing in sustainable \\ninfrastructure. SLIs innovative construction process creates mid- and high-rise multifamily \\nbuildings while incorporating features such as recycled steel trusses and energy-efcient, low-\\nemission, reduced-water building systems. Furthermore, because building components arrive at \\nbuilding sites preassembled, construction takes up less room, requires less energy and creates \\nless disruption in local communities. SLPs rst mid-rise multifamily building is underway \\n in downtown Seattle and is expected to be certied as a net-zero energy building.\\nSUPPORTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT \\nOur Urban Investment Group (UIG) has deployed over $1 billion annually in community \\n and economic development. \\nINVESTING \\nIN COMMUNITIES \\nAccess to health care is a \\n challenge in many underserved urban \\nneighborhoods. \\nOdyssey House Louisiana \\n(OHL) is a multiparty development that is \\nturning a former automotive factory into a state-\\nof-the-art healthcare facility in New Orleans.\\nWe invested $5 million to support the \\n renovation, which will yield 37,000 square feet \\n for the healthcare facility and another 4,000 \\nsquare feet of new retail space. The development \\nwill increase OHLs ability to provide behavioral \\nhealth and substance abuse treatment critical \\n to ghting the current battle against opioid \\naddiction. In addition, it will boost economic development in the area, bringing 45 jobs to \\n a neighborhood with a 52 percent poverty rate \\nand a 37 percent unemployment rate at the \\ntime of investment closing. OHL has remained \\nopen throughout the entire COVID-19 crisis \\n and has even expanded its services, offering \\ntelehealth in its Community Health Center and \\nopening a drive-through COVID-19 testing site \\nopen to drivers and bicyclists. OHL is the \\n only testing site in New Orleans to accept \\nindividuals on bikes  key for its client \\npopulation, which typically does not have \\n access to a private vehicle.\\nADVANCING \\nNEIGHBORHOOD \\n HEALTH \\n AND ECONOMIC \\n DEVELOPMENT\\n27IN ECUADOR, SUPPORTING \\n FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS \\nSOCIAL BONDS TO BATTLE COVID\\n-19Goldman Sachs worked with Ecuador to issue a $400 million \\n social bond  the rst social bond issuance by a sovereign  \\n to support Casa Para Todos, \\nan Ecuadorian government program \\ndesigned to build affordable housing. The issuance is expected to aid \\nin the purchase of more than 24,000 homes for rst-time buyers from \\nlow- and middle-income families and includes a mandate to accelerate \\nmortgage lending for women-led households. The social bond includes \\n a $300 million credit guarantee from the Inter-American Development \\nBank, which lowered the cost for the Republic of Ecuador. \\nThe Casa Para Todos program represents the third subsidized social \\nhousing program implemented in recent years by Ecuador. It is aligned \\nwith a number of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, \\nincluding reducing poverty, increasing access to water and sanitation, \\nreducing inequality within and among countries, and making more cities \\nand human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\\nTo help alleviate the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 \\npandemic, \\nthis year we have led over $15 billion of COVID-related bonds \\nglobally. For example, we worked with the African Development Bank to \\nissue a $3 billion Fight COVID-19 Social Bond. The bond provides support \\nand nancing to countries and businesses ghting against COVID-19 \\n and helps investors support African communities to curb the spread \\n of the virus and overcome the many challenges caused by the outbreak. \\nWe also underwrote the Inter-American Development Bank $2billion \\nSustainable Development Bond as part of their $12 billion COVID-19 \\nresponse package, the Republic of Austria 7.5 billion issuance  \\n part of whose proceeds will support a 4 billion COVID-19 emergency \\n fund  and the French Development Agency 1.5 billion issuance.\\nINNOVATIVE \\nFINANCING APPROACHES \\n\\n28INVESTING IN PHILANTHROPY \\n TO DRIVE GLOBAL GROWTH \\nFor areas related to inclusive growth where there is not an immediate market opportunity, we strive to develop \\nphilanthropic initiatives that level the playing eld and spark economic growth in communities around the world. \\nAs a rm, we approach this work with the same rigor and innovation we commit to our everyday business. \\nAcross our philanthropic programs, the rm has invested more than $2.5 billion to date.\\nASSESSING THE \\nCONTINUED IMPACT \\nOF 10,000 SMALL \\nBUSINESSES IN THE \\nUS AND THE UK\\n 10,000 Small Businesses\\n US Our 10,000 Small Businesses\\n (10KSB\\n) initiative is a $500 million investment to help entrepreneurs create jobs \\n and economic opportunity by providing access to education, capital and support services to growth-oriented \\n small businesses. The program partners with community colleges and universities across the country to deliver an \\nintensive 10-week program to small business owners in both urban and rural areas. It also provides access to \\n capital through partnerships with Community Development Financial Institutions and other mission-driven lenders. \\nIn 2019, \\n10KSB\\n launched a statewide program in Ohio, in partnership with four community colleges, committing \\n an additional $15 million to local small businesses and bringing the total commitment in Ohio to $30 million. \\n The program also sponsored the Presidential Forum Series in Iowa and New Hampshire. The Series invited \\n 2020 presidential candidates to discuss economic and social issues with the local community, including small \\nbusiness priorities.By the end of 2019, more than 9,100 small business owners had graduated from the program across all 50 states, \\nWashington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Graduates of \\n10KSB\\n routinely outpace the national average of revenue growth \\n and job creation of small businesses: 67 percent increase revenues within six months of graduation  compared \\nto the 53 percent national average over the same period. Further, 47 percent create new jobs just six months after \\ngraduation, compared to the 30 percent national average over the same period. \\n\\n292019 saw continued innovations from \\n10,000 Women\\n (10KW\\n), our signature \\nprogram that empowers women entrepreneurs in communities worldwide. \\nThe \\n10KW\\n Online course enables women entrepreneurs in more regions to access \\n the programs business curriculum. The online program, which closely follows the \\n in-person 10KW\\n experience, includes 10 modules covering a range of business topics, \\nfrom identifying opportunities for growth to nancial planning, management techniques, \\nmarketing and leadership. By the end of the year, the \\n10KW\\n Online program had reached women from 170 countries. \\nIn the fall of 2019, Goldman Sachs convened a select group of \\n10KW\\n Online graduates at our headquarters for business coaching and training designed to take business \\ngrowth to the next level. These entrepreneurs received customized learning that \\ncomplemented the online course. In India, 10KW\\n relaunched its in-classroom collaboration with the Indian Institute of \\nManagement Bangalore (IIMB). The program graduated three cohorts, each consisting \\nof 180 women entrepreneurs, expanded to Mumbai in November, and plans to expand \\nto Delhi in 2020. During the in-classroom experience, entrepreneurs receive 15 days of \\ninstruction over the course of several months, in subjects that include business nance, \\nmarketing, operations and workforce development. Program alumni can also join the \\n10KW \\nAmbassadors Program, an advanced course launched in 2019 that enables the \\nentrepreneurs to further scale their businesses.10,000 Women\\n Measures Impacts in China In Beijing, 10,000 Women\\n held a 10-year alumni summit at Tsinghua University School \\nof Economics and Management.

In addition, the rms \\nnew global parenting policy allows for 20 weeks of leave, an \\nincrease from 16 weeks in the United States, Asia Pacic \\nand other regions around the world.\\nThe rm also introduced four weeks of paid family care \\n leave globally. This enables colleagues to care for family \\nmembers, as needed, due to serious health conditions, foster placement or military deployment. Additionally, we \\nlaunched \\nPathways to Parenthood\\n, which increases existing \\nstipends for adoption and surrogacy, and provides stipends \\nfor egg retrieval and egg donation where permitted by law. \\nAside from leave, the rm supports expecting parents with \\na wide range of programs and services. These include a \\ndedicated expectant-parent coordinator who can provide \\nguidance on the rms benets, facilities and mentoring \\nopportunities, and healthcare plan provisions that include a \\nhealthy-pregnancy program, with a focus on prenatal care, \\nlabor and delivery, and newborn care.\\nENHANCING OUR \\nSUPPORT FOR \\nEXPECTANT PARENTS\\nAt Goldman Sachs, we recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace, they need support in their personal as \\nwell as their professional lives. For this reason, we have created a strong support framework for wellness, enabling them to \\nbetter balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. The past year saw signicant additions to that framework, \\nincluding increased support for expectant and new parents. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our \\npeople a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. As we grapple with the impacts of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, these resources remain available and weve continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with \\nthe aim of maintaining physical and mental well-being, effectiveness and cohesiveness of our global community. We rolled out \\nnew telemedicine services that provide our employees and their families with access to physicians (24/7) through live video \\nor telephone. In addition, for the rest of 2020, the rm is waiving the costs of urgent care medical visits, including COVID-19 \\nconsultations. We also introduced a COVID-19 10-day family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family \\nmembers due to COVID-19 related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. \\nManagers play an important role in fostering a culture of inclusion  \\n and training managers to build inclusivity is a continued focus.\\n For \\nexample, an online learning module for all new managers is \\nBuilding an Inclusive Environment\\n, in which managers learn to identify and address \\ncommon diversity and inclusion considerations within their teams, and to build \\na work environment that maximizes the potential of all team members. In the \\nprogram Identity Matters: Race and Ethnicity in the Workplace\\n, participants learn about how race, ethnicity and social identity can shape an individuals \\nworkplace experience, and how dialogue about race and identity can create \\ntrust-based relationships. \\nSupport also extends to helping leaders manage family leaves and expectant \\nparents. In 2019, our Global Diversity Committee and Human Capital \\nManagement Division introduced Great Expectations: Managing Parenting-\\nRelated Leaves\\n, an eLearning program that delivers information and best \\npractices for preparing for colleagues time off and facilitating a successful \\nreturn to work.\\nTips gained through this training include how to encourage new parents to \\ntake the leave of absence, understanding how expecting a baby can generate \\nanxiety at home and work, and how to keep lines of communication open \\nduring leaves so that colleagues remain up to speed on new developments \\nand emerging team opportunities. \\nWe believe managers play a critical role in ensuring that working parents \\n have the support and resources they need to thrive in the workplace  and \\nthat they understand that the rm, and its managers, are there to support \\nthem throughout the process.HELPING MANAGERS \\nSTRENGTHEN A CULTURE OF \\nINCLUSION AND SUPPORT\\n38ENGAGING OUR PEOPLE \\n TO DRIVE IMPACT\\nEntrepreneurship and innovation have always been a core \\npart of the Goldman Sachs culture. \\nWe believe in cultivating an \\nenvironment where our people can work together, think big and \\nshape the future with their ideas.\\nGS Accelerate\\n is an initiative to foster innovation and collaboration \\nat the rm.

Last year, we completed our rst power purchase agreement for on-site power \\ngeneration  through solar carports at the new headquarters of our Ayco subsidiary in upstate \\nNew York, meeting 60 percent of the buildings electrical needs.\\nEV100 (Electric Vehicle):\\n Goldman Sachs has also begun a rmwide push to support electric \\ntransport, installing 119 EV chargers at our Bengaluru campus for EV-driving employees and ground \\ntransportation vendors. Our Ayco headquarters also installed EV chargers, and were committed to \\ninstalling EV infrastructure in all rm-owned ofces that provide parking, and encouraging landlords \\nto do the same in the ofces we lease.\\nEP100 (Energy Productivity):\\n Goldman Sachs recognizes that reducing our energy consumption \\nand operating efcient ofces is a critical component of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The \\nrms commitment to EP100 is aligned with the Net Zero Carbon Building compliance pathway, \\nwhich will focus on reducing the impacts of our global real estate portfolio, by consolidating into \\nmore efcient real estate, retrotting existing spaces to LEED Gold or equivalent standards, or \\ncreating green campuses. Our new BREEAM Excellent certied London ofce has achieved a \\n50 percent reduction in utility consumption compared to our previous campus due to 100 percent \\nLED lighting. Additionally, we have retrotted lighting at our New York and New Jersey ofces \\n with LEDs, saving approximately 6 million kWh of electricity use per year.\\nReducing Our Operational Impacts (continued)A THREE-WAY PATH TO \\n ENERGY TRANSFORMATION\\n\\n41In 2019, we further advanced our strategy to \\nbuild a sustainable supply chain.\\n We piloted an \\nESG self-assessment survey with 80 vendors in \\nindustries perceived to have the highest ESG risk \\nexposure to better understand the controls \\n in place to manage environmental, labor and \\nhuman rights requirements detailed in our \\nVendor Code of Conduct. And we are leveraging \\nthese ndings to further enhance our responsible supply chain practices. Our goals for the coming \\nyear also include a deeper assessment of \\nvendors in industries exposed to high risk of \\nslavery and human trafcking.\\nA key priority for our rm is fostering opportunities \\nwith small, as well as women- and minority-\\nowned, businesses, with the aim of achieving \\na supply chain that reects the diversity of our \\npeople and our clients. In 2019, we focused on \\nincreasing the rms network and access to \\ndiverse businesses, expanding our memberships \\nwith certifying agencies. In 2020, we will enhance \\nour reporting capabilities and we will \\nremain focused on our 2025 goals.\\nWe are committed to diverting 100 percent of business waste \\n from landll by the end of 2020.\\n Our responsible waste management \\npractices prioritize reducing the amount of waste we generate, \\nmaximizing recycling and composting, and utilizing waste-to-energy \\nfacilities where available. In 2019, the rm made signicant efforts \\n toward these commitments.\\nPaper:\\n We launched \\n#goDigital\\n, a campaign to eliminate 10 million print \\npages of output annually from our operations. Opportunities to reduce \\nconsumption range from eliminating paper-based client communications \\nto fully leveraging digital media for internal communications and reducing \\nreliance on printed promotional material. In addition, we eliminated paper \\ncups in our ofces and shifted to reusable mugs, eliminating more than \\n200 tons of waste annually. \\nPlastics: We met our commitment to remove 85 percent of single-use \\nplastics from our global operations, including plastic bottles and straws, \\nand plastic lm presentation covers and binders.\\nFood:\\n We are also working to reduce food waste in our cafeterias and \\nmicro-market cafes. In January 2019, we began to partner with Rethink \\nFood in New York to ensure that excess, unused food is donated and \\ntransitioned into ready-to-eat, nutrition-dense meals. Through this \\npartnership, and collaboration with the Conrad Hotel, we were able \\n to transform more than 32,000 pounds of food into the equivalent of \\n45,000 meals for New York City families in need. \\nFurniture:\\n We responsibly managed the disposal of 30,000 pieces \\n of existing furniture when moving from our legacy campus in London \\n to Plumtree Court  ensuring nothing was \\n sent to landll. By partnering with Waste \\nMatch, we are donating more than \\n 9,000 pieces of furniture to local charities, \\nschools and medical establishments, \\n while responsibly recycling an additional \\n 500 tons of metal. \\nE-Waste:\\n We partnered with eWorks, \\n a certied electronics recycling and \\nrefurbishment services company that \\ncreates employment opportunities \\n for those with disabilities.

Our \\nFramework includes a number of basic tenets:\\n  \\nWe manage environmental and social risks with the same care \\n and discipline as we do other business risks\\n  \\nWe weigh environmental and social impacts in all relevant \\n business selection decisions  \\nWe engage with clients to identify signicant ESG issues, and \\n help them adopt appropriate safeguards and sustainable practices \\n where feasible\\n  \\nWe decline assignments when client engagement is not possible, \\nwhen potential impacts cannot be mitigated, and when unacceptable \\nrisks conict with our environmental and social policy guidelines\\nOur Framework also helps us work with clients to develop \\nenvironmental and social risk disclosures as appropriate. In addition, \\nwe proactively monitor developments  from emerging ESG issues \\nto evolving best practices  and periodically review and update our \\nguidelines to reect these developments.\\nGoldman Sachs was one of the rst nancial institutions to underscore \\nthe urgency of addressing climate change through our EPF. We \\ncontinue to enhance environmental and social risk management \\nguidelines for carbon-intense sectors. This includes no direct nancing \\nof new coal-red power plant development globally without carbon \\ncapture-and-storage technology, no direct nancing of new thermal coal \\nmine development, and no new nancing that directly supports new \\nupstream Arctic oil exploration or development. We work with clients \\nacross all industries on climate transition, including with power sector \\nclients to help them diversify and reduce GHG emissions to transition \\nin-line with the Paris Agreement.\\nBecause risk management is so critical to responsibly running our rm, \\nwe focus on training our people in risk management globally, including \\ntraining with respect to environmental and social risk. As our rst line \\nof defense, our people undergo specialized training by sector and \\nindustry, particularly in sectors we believe have higher potential for \\nenvironmental and social risk.\\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\nOUR RISK MANAGEMENT\\nDeals Reviewed (2019)\\nFor Environmental and Social Risks1,612\\nPotential Transactions Reviewed\\n1 Other includes agriculture, biotech, housing, palm oil and transactions for nancial sponsors related to loan portfolios across various sectors. \\nOil & GasPower GenerationMetals & MiningChemicalsTransportation\\nOther1Water \\nInfrastructure ForestryBiofuelsSector (2019)\\n61734125541201958830187\\n44Goldman Sachs supports the work of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a market-driven initiative aimed at \\ncreating a voluntary, consistent global framework for providing information on climate-related nancial risks to investors, lenders, insurers \\n and other stakeholders.Launched after the Paris Agreement by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global nancial system, TCFD reporting provides decision-useful information that improves the understanding and analysis of material \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities. In this spirit, Goldman Sachs has published an inaugural report (see page 56) that details our approach \\nto managing climate-related risks and opportunities across our businesses and operations, including the initial steps we have taken on \\ntransition and physical climate-risk scenario analysis. Our approach is multifaceted across both opportunities and risks and continues to advance as both the market and our clients needs evolve and as data, technology and tools improve over time. Since our initial 2005 Environmental Policy Framework (EPF), we have continued to \\nintegrate climate change risk mitigation and opportunities across our rm. The report covers a range of topics.\\nAmong the highlights:Managing Risks (continued)Governance How the management and oversight of climate change is integrated across our existing governance structure, including at the management and Board level. Our approach ensures that climate change is strategically managed and the expertise of the rm is both integrated and leveraged across relevant committees and functions.Strategy How weve built on the roadmap laid out in our EPF, by establishing the Sustainable \\nFinance Group in 2019 and a cross-divisional Steering Group to deepen our expertise and deliver that expertise to our clients. Also, how in 2019, we announced a new sustainable nance target of $750 billion of nancing, investing and advisory activity by 2030 and will continue to work with clients across sectors globally to accelerate climate transition in an orderly and inclusive way.\\nRisk Management How climate risk is integrated into our existing risk management as well as the initiatives we are undertaking to further integrate climate-related factors and scenarios into our risk management and business selection processes, including initial scenario analysis of (1) transition risk for our balance sheet-related equity and credit assets and (2) physical risk for our global properties. Over time, our goal is to both rene the methodology and assumptions and expand the scope of analysis. Metrics and Targets\\n Going forward, we will monitor and report capital deployed in clean energy as one of the nine growth themes underlying our $750 billion sustainable nance goal, and the progress we make against new operational targets we have set for 2025, with a focus on strategic, collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation.Risk management is integrated throughout the rm. In our advisory, \\nnancing and investing activity, we focus on transaction risk and conduct \\nenhanced review when transactions involve companies with the potential \\nfor negative ESG impacts or vulnerabilities. At the highest level, we \\nbroadly examine legal, regulatory, environmental, social and governance \\nrisks, and review potential transactions through a risk management lens.\\nAt an operational level, in-house teams with strong technical expertise \\nguide environmental, health and safety (EHS) standards for our investing \\n activities. The teams also perform EHS due diligence on proposed \\ninvestment transactions, helping business teams identify and mitigate \\npotential risk factors. In these direct investments, we closely and \\ncontinually examine potential risks in our portfolio. This includes \\nmonitoring portfolio companies and engaging with their managers \\n as appropriate.In 2019, Goldman Sachs identied and managed EHS risks in a number \\nof potential transactions and portfolio companies, and in some cases, \\nforwent the transaction if risks were high and could not be mitigated. For \\nexample, when the rm was completing the due diligence on a multi-\\nfamily property acquisition, our expanded due diligence scope identied \\nthat the on-site water supply well was being inadequately treated. After \\nadditional diligence into the causes and impacts of this water quality \\nconcern, we decided not to participate in the transaction.\\nIn another case, when considering the acquisition of an industrial \\nportfolio with a dozen facilities in Europe, we identied a number of \\nsignicant deciencies in EHS governance. Working with the Operational \\nRisk Management & Analysis Environmental Specialist Team, we required \\ndetailed EHS audits as a condition for the approval of the transaction. \\n As a result, detailed corrective action plans were developed for each \\nfacility to address the deciencies, including additional stafng and \\nenhanced authority of corporate EHS leadership, as well as development \\nof a rmwide EHS governance process and improvements to localized \\nEHS procedures. \\n(continued from previous page)A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE\\n\\n45Managing Risks (continued)Appropriate oversight by our management and Board of \\nDirectors, as well as strong policies and practices, are key \\ncontributors to our ability to effectively manage a broad \\nspectrum of nancial and nonnancial risks across our \\nbusinesses, including with respect to ESG considerations.\\nOur Board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the \\nmanagement of the rms most signicant risks, placing signicant \\nfocus on reputational risk and managements operation of the rm \\nresponsibly for the long term. The Boards Public Responsibilities \\nCommittee (PRC) has primary oversight of our rmwide approach to \\nsustainability and related risks, including through the review of key \\nESG policies. Our ESG policies and procedures provide transparency \\ninto our practices and are generally developed with the consultation \\nof stakeholders, including regulators and investors. Signicantly, ESG and sustainability oversight is not limited to just the PRC, \\nbut also informs discussions with other committees and the full Board on topics ranging from climate risk to human capital \\nmanagement to the rms broader sustainable nance initiatives.\\nOversight of the rms culture is an important element of how the Board engages on the rms reputation, particularly \\nbecause our people are our greatest asset. Our Board holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining and \\ncommunicating the rms culture throughout the rm. Core to our success is that our focus on risk and reputation extends \\nthroughout every level of Goldman Sachs.\\nTo this end, our people are trained in our Business Standards and Principles, which were recently distilled into our Core Values, \\nand underscore the responsibility of every employee to uphold our culture of teamwork, excellence, personal initiative and \\naccountability. At the management level, our rms committee structure serves to emphasize these points. Our committees are \\ngenerally composed of senior managers from our rst and second lines of defense. These committees have specic oversight \\nor decision-making responsibilities for various risk management activities. For example, while our Enterprise Risk Committee \\nis globally responsible for overseeing all of the rms risks, both nancial and nonnancial, our Firmwide Reputational Risk \\nCommittee is responsible for vetting transactions that have the potential for heightened reputational risk.\\nRISK-CENTERED \\nGOVERNANCEOur culture has been a cornerstone of our business and performance throughout our 150-year history. Our 14 Business Principles, which \\n were codied in 1979, outline our commitment to our clients and our cultural expectations, including how teamwork, excellence, personal \\ninitiative and accountability are integral to our long-term success. These principles continue to guide us and were recently distilled into our \\nCore Values, which inform everything that we do.\\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines our shared responsibility to our clients, our colleagues and our communities. Goldman Sachs is committed to ensuring our culture of integrity remains a core value. \\nWe remain intensely focused on the impact that the conduct of our people can have on our rms reputation. To further elevate and reinforce \\nthis focus, we have now created a Firmwide Conduct Committee, which is globally responsible for the oversight of conduct risk.\\nIn particular, the Firmwide Conduct Committee seeks to ensure that our frameworks and policies appropriately mitigate the risk that our \\npeople fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and Core Values, thereby falling short in fullling their responsibilities \\n to the rm, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community.\\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF OUR CULTURE \\n\\n46KEY METRICS AND INDICATORS\\nGoldman Sachs U.S. Workforce Demographics*\\nWhite\\nAsian\\nBlack or \\n African \\nAmerican\\nAmerican \\nIndian/\\n Alaskan \\n Native\\nHispanic or \\nLatinx\\nTwo or More \\nRaces\\nNative \\nHawaiian \\n  or Other \\nPacic \\nIslander\\nFemales\\nExec/Sr. Ofcials & Managers\\n77.3%14.5%2.7%0.1%4.4%1.0%0.0%23.4%Ofcials & Managers\\n55.9%33.7%4.4%0.1%4.8%1.1%0.0%28.6%Professionals\\n53.1%28.7%5.8%0.1%9.8%2.3%0.2%39.6%All Others\\n57.5%8.2%15.9%0.1%15.4%2.5%0.4%59.9%Total\\n55.6%25.6%6.6%0.1%9.6%2.1%0.2%39.8%Source: Data anticipated to be led in Goldman Sachs 2019 EEO-1 report.

We also believe in the importance of \\nproviding greater transparency on our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities \\nacross our business and operations. \\nOur inaugural \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) Report\\n provides an \\noverview of our strategy and approach to climate-related risks and opportunities, including how the \\nmanagement and oversight of climate change is integrated across our global business. We also include \\nin this report the initial steps we have undertaken on climate risk scenario analysis to understand the \\nimpacts of both transition risk and physical risk. \\nWe recognize that climate change is highly complex and that it is inherently difcult to project \\nhow related nancial risks will materialize across the global economy and markets. In addition, \\nclimate scenario analysis is relatively new and evolving rapidly, including with respect to underlying \\nassumptions, methodologies and data. As such, this report represents the rst step in our journey \\nwith the commitment to deepening our understanding of and advancing our approach to \\n climate-related risks and opportunities over time.\\nClimate-related opportunities and risks manifest in many different ways across our businesses. We see signicant \\nopportunities across our nancing, investing, asset management, advisory and risk management activities as we work with \\nour clients to help address the climate challenge. At the same time, extreme weather events may disrupt operations or \\naffect the value of our investments, negative nancial impacts on clients from climate change may increase credit risk, and \\ninvolvement in certain industries associated with climate change may pose reputational risk. Given the broad-based impacts \\nof climate change, our cohesive strategy leverages the breadth of our global businesses and the depth of our expertise and \\ninsights to advance climate-related opportunities and to manage climate risk.\\nOur strategy includes a 10-year, $750 billion strategic target to nance, invest and advise clients across nine sustainable \\ngrowth themes, which underlie climate transition and inclusive growth. In addition, given global economies for the \\nforeseeable future are dependent on fossil-based energy and carbon-intensive activities, we are committed to supporting \\nclients across all industries in their efforts to accelerate their climate transition and doing so in an orderly manner. This \\n enables us to not only better serve the interests of our clients but also more effectively manage our own risk exposures.\\nIn 2019, we strengthened our rmwide efforts by establishing the Sustainable Finance Group (SFG), which reports to the \\nChairmans Ofce and is responsible for partnering with our global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise \\nand drive innovative solutions for our clients. This effort is supported by a cross-divisional steering group of senior business \\nleaders to deliver the breadth of our capabilities. \\nOur strategy also entails understanding and managing climate-related physical, transition and reputational risks. This is \\nembedded both in our comprehensive rmwide risk management approach and more specically in our climate change risk \\nmanagement framework. In addition to managing risk across our client activities and related balance sheet exposure and \\nreputational risk, we continue to adopt best practices to reduce our own carbon footprint and integrate resiliency into our \\nglobal operations. Underlying our strategy is an ongoing commitment to deepening our understanding and knowledge of, and progressing our \\napproach to, managing climate risks and advancing market opportunities. To that end, we leverage the lessons learned from \\nmanaging our own business and serving our clients, as well as from our external stakeholder engagement, to help inform the \\nwork we do and further best practices across the nancial services industry and more broadly. We also harness our research insights \\nand thought leadership to help inform markets and policy, and engage in broader partnerships to further market solutions. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n59Governance Given climate-related impacts manifest across our businesses in different ways, oversight and management of climate \\nchange is integrated into our existing governance structure. This helps to ensure that climate change is strategically \\nmanaged and the expertise of the rm is both integrated and leveraged across relevant committees and functions. \\nAt the most senior level, under the oversight of the Board of Directors and at the direction of senior management, we \\n are committed to serving our clients and delivering robust risk management, including on climate-related opportunities and \\nrisks. Our focus on not only clients but on effective risk and controls is core to our commitment to excellence, as reected \\n in our Core Values, \\nBusiness Principles\\n, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.Board of Directors: \\nOur Board of Directors\\n (the Board) and its committees are responsible for overseeing the management of the rms \\nmost signicant risks, placing signicant focus on reputational risk and managements operation of the rm for the \\n long term.  \\nThe Boards \\nPublic Responsibilities Committee\\n (PRC) provides oversight of our rmwide sustainability strategy and \\nsustainability issues affecting the rm, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the PRC \\nreceives updates on the rms Environmental Policy Framework (EPF), which serves as an ambitious roadmap for how \\nwe seek to leverage our people, capital and ideas to address critical environmental challenges and promote sustainable \\neconomic growth across our businesses. The EPF also includes environmental and social risk guidelines, including for \\ncarbon-intensive sectors. \\n  \\nThe \\nRisk Committee\\n of the Board oversees the rms overall risk-taking tolerance and management of nancial and non-\\nnancial risks, including climate risk. In this respect, the Risk Committee provides oversight of the rms Risk Appetite \\nStatement (RAS), which conveys the rms view of its risk culture, risk appetite and risk management philosophies, \\nincluding those related to climate change.\\nTCFD Appendix\\n60Firmwide Committees: \\nIn addition to Board-level oversight, we have a series of rm-level committees with risk management mandates that have \\noversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities and environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG) issues, including relevant climate change considerations. At a rmwide level, the \\nEnterprise Risk Committee\\n oversees all of our nancial and non-nancial risks, including climate-related risk. \\nIn addition, we have rm-level risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions \\nand entities. For example, the \\nFirmwide Capital Committee\\n, which approves and oversees debt-related transactions, \\nincluding balance sheet-related commitments, integrates relevant climate-related considerations. For our own operations, \\nthe Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee\\n provides oversight over operational risk and resiliency, \\nincluding physical risks relating to climate change. \\nAll of our committees have responsibility for considering the reputational impact of transactions and activities that they \\nreview. The \\nFirmwide Reputational Risk Committee\\n provides oversight over transactions that may have heightened \\nreputational risk, which includes considerations relating to environmental and social factors, such as climate-related \\nreputational risk.\\nBelow are relevant key committees. \\nCommitteeDescriptionManagement CommitteeOversees global activities directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders. Firmwide Enterprise Risk CommitteeOversees all of our nancial and non-nancial risks as well as the ongoing review, approval and \\nmonitoring of our enterprise risk management framework.Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee Assesses reputational risks arising from transactions that have been identied as having potential heightened reputational risk.Firmwide Capital CommitteeApproves and oversees debt-related transactions and ensures that business, reputational and  suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis.Firmwide Commitments CommitteeApproves and oversees underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity-related products, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis.Firmwide Investment Policy CommitteeReviews, approves, sets policies and oversees certain principal investments, including review of  risk management and controls for these types of investments.Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk CommitteeOversees operational risk, and ensures our business and operational resilience. Physical Commodity Review CommitteeMaintains a consistent approach to evaluating risks associated with engaging in, investing in, or the nancing of physical commodity activities that may have an impact on the environment or human  health and safety.\\nTCFD Appendix\\n61Relevant Divisions/Functions: \\nClimate change risks and opportunities are integrated across relevant areas of our businesses. As part of their \\nresponsibilities, the following three divisions/functions play a specic role in managing climate-related risks and \\nopportunities and ensuring that we continue to advance our insights and expertise.\\n  Risk Division: The Risk Division has a range of climate-related functions, working with business units and control \\ngroups on risk identication and stress-testing activities. The division also assesses nancial risks of counterparties and \\ntransactions, including credit risk. In addition, the division oversees the rms operational resilience framework, which \\nfactors in potential impacts from climate-related risks on the rms activities.\\n  Executive Ofce (EO)  Sustainable Finance Group (SFG): \\nThe SFG, which reports to the Ofce of the Chairman, \\n is responsible for partnering with the rms global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise and capabilities \\nto our clients and drive innovative market solutions that advance climate transition and inclusive growth. SFG also \\nengages with the rms stakeholders to stay abreast of and, where relevant, help inform sustainable nance and climate \\nchange-related policy. In addition, SFG works with the Business Intelligence Group, the Risk Division and the business \\nunits on rmwide environmental and social risk management and related guidelines. By being part of the EO and \\nworking across all of the global businesses, clients and stakeholders, SFG brings together the breadth of our knowledge \\nand capabilities and ensures we continue to deliver our insights and expertise.\\n  \\nServices Division  Corporate Services & Real Estate (CSRE), Crisis Management Group:\\n The Services Division \\nprovides essential commercial advisory and management services to enable the rms ow of business, drive \\noperational efciency, manage risk and deliver the worlds best work experience and environment. CSRE partners \\n with the Crisis Management Group to assess and plan for near- and long-term climate-related risks across our operations \\nthrough infrastructure and business continuity reviews of the rms global corporate real estate portfolio. This enables \\nclimate-related risk to be actively monitored and threats to be minimized to ensure the rm operates continuously \\nthrough and swiftly recovers from any business disruption.\\nCross-Divisional Groups: \\nIn addition to the specic divisions/functions, we have established cross-divisional steering groups to more effectively \\nleverage the rms capabilities and activities and to ensure a holistic, rmwide approach to managing climate-related risks \\nand opportunities. These include: \\n  \\nSustainable Finance Steering Group:\\n Comprised of senior leaders responsible for integrating sustainability expertise \\nacross our divisions and bringing our capabilities together across the rm. The group convenes periodically to guide \\nand support rmwide sustainable nance efforts relating to key strategic initiatives and client delivery, while providing \\nleadership for cross-divisional work streams and new opportunities.\\n  Climate Change Risk Steering Group:\\n Comprised of representatives from the Risk Division, Services Division and the \\nExecutive Ofce that are responsible for evaluating climate-related scenario analysis and the broader TCFD assessment. \\nThis group also reviews the implementation of the strategic climate risk management approach outlined in this report to \\nstrengthen climate-related nancial risk integration across our businesses and practices. TCFD Appendix\\n62Strategy  Advancing the OpportunityAs markets and client activity shift in response to climate change, we have a substantial opportunity to harness innovative \\ncapital market tools and partner with our clients to help accelerate their climate transition. In addition, our ability to \\nleverage the breadth of our capabilities, our commitment to continuously deepening our expertise and rening our insights, \\nand applying these both across our own operations and in serving our clients needs, ensures we stay front-footed in \\nintegrating climate change opportunities and risks.\\nIn December 2019, we announced a new \\nsustainable nance target\\n of $750 billion of nancing, investing and advisory \\nactivity by 2030. This target encompasses activities across nine strategic growth themes, which are rooted in 10+ years \\n of market research, focused on climate transition and inclusive growth. Areas of focus in our climate transition activity \\ninclude clean energy, sustainable transport, sustainable food and agriculture, waste and material, as well as ecosystem \\nservices  areas where we can help scale technology and solutions through greater and more efcient capital \\ndeployment. In addition to this target, we have expanded our work with clients more broadly to help them with their \\nclimate transition and in ensuring sustainable growth more broadly, and we are harnessing innovative market solutions \\n to help clients better manage and adapt to climate risks. \\nLeveraging the Breadth of Our Businesses We leverage our capabilities across nancing, advisory, risk management solutions, asset management and investing \\nto help our clients achieve their climate-related goals, facilitate the low-carbon transition, and strengthen adaptation and \\nresiliency. The following table provides an overview. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n63Business ActivityKey Examples Investment Banking: Our Investment Banking franchise is well- positioned to support clients with climate transition strategies  and to assist both incumbents and new companies to innovate and  grow.

Read the reports \\nhere. For additional details, please refer to our \\n2019 Sustainability Report\\n.1GSAM Stewardship Report, 2019.TCFD Appendix\\n64Public Policy and Industry Engagement We continue to work with other companies, nonprot organizations and other stakeholders to share insights and \\n further best practices that advance sustainability and climate transition. In addition, where appropriate, we advocate for \\neffective climate policy to help inform ways to advance market solutions that can help address climate change. \\n The following are examples. \\n  Paris Climate Agreement:\\n We have actively engaged in making the business case for global climate action, including \\nsupport for the 2015 \\nUNFCCC Paris Agreement. We were one of the rst US companies to commit to the \\nWhite House American Business Act on Climate Pledge in 2015\\n; we signed an \\nopen letter alongside 29 other CEOs\\n in 2017 to support \\nthe US staying in the Paris Agreement; and more recently, we were part of a \\ngroup of 80+ CEOs and labour leaders reiterating our support that staying in the Paris Agreement will strengthen US competitiveness in global markets.\\n  Carbon pricing:\\n We have long articulated the need for governments to provide transparency around the costs of \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to create long-term value for GHG emissions reductions. More recently, in a \\nDecember 2019 \\neditorial, our CEO David Solomon underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and \\ncalled for governments to put a price on carbon. In February 2020, Goldman Sachs, alongside more than 25 companies, \\njoined as a founding member of the \\nClimate Leadership Council\\n (CLC) to support a revenue-neutral carbon fee and \\ndividend plan for the US.\\n  \\nCatalyzing climate nance:\\n We have continued to leverage our market insights to help catalyze greater capital ows \\n to address climate change. In 2019, we joined the CEO-led \\nClimate Finance Leadership Initiative\\n (CFLI) as one of seven founding members, to support greater mobilization of climate nance ows. In September 2019, CFLI delivered \\nits Financing the Low-Carbon Future\\n report to the UN to inform ways to further mobilize private climate nance at the \\nscale and speed needed to support a rapid and orderly transition to a low-carbon global economy.\\n  \\nIntegrating climate-related risks and opportunities:\\n In 2019, Goldman Sachs Asset Management teamed up with a \\nselect group of other leading asset managers to advance climate-related investment among national sovereign wealth \\nfunds (SWFs). Known as the \\nOne Planet Asset Managers Initiative\\n, this collaboration supports the efforts of the One \\nPlanet SWF Working Group, composed of leading sovereign wealth funds, to drive a deeper consideration of the impact \\nof climate change on investment portfolios.\\nOperational Best PracticesIn addition to harnessing the breadth of our businesses to help our clients with their climate transition and scaling innovative market solutions to address climate change, Goldman Sachs is committed to being a leader in implementing \\nsustainability practices that minimize the impact of our global operations on the environment. For example, we have been \\ncarbon neutral from 2015 onward across our global direct Scope 1, indirect (market-based) Scope 2, and Scope 3 business \\ntravel emissions. Additionally, by year-end 2020, we are committed to procuring 100% renewable energy and attaining \\nLEED Gold or equivalent for 70 percent of our global corporate real estate footprint.\\nIn December 2019, we established a new suite of 2025 operational sustainability goals with a focus on strategic, \\ncollaborative partnerships that drive market transformation, as outlined in our \\nSustainability Report\\n. The rm has been a \\nmember of RE100\\n since 2015 and recently joined additional initiatives \\nEV100\\n and EP100\\n with ambitious commitments  to electrify transport and deploy smarter energy use  making us the rst US company to become a member of all three \\n of The Climate Group\\ns global corporate leadership initiatives to accelerate the clean energy transition. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n65Risk Management Because we are a global nancial services rm with clients operating in diverse sectors and ofces across many \\n countries, climate change presents a range of potential risk considerations across our businesses and activities. For \\nexample, climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary \\nlocations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients and also may adversely affect the \\nvalue of our investments. Climate change may also have a negative impact on the nancial condition of our clients, which \\nmay decrease cash ows from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures \\nto these clients. Additionally, our reputation may be impacted as a result of our involvement, or our clients involvement, \\n in certain industries or projects associated with climate change. \\nThe table below provides a description of the range of climate-related risk considerations. \\nRiskDescription MarketPhysical and transition risk could impact the value of assets in which we make markets and invest.CreditCounterparty nancial performance and collateral values could deteriorate as the transition  and physical impacts of climate change manifest over time.LiquidityClimate-related disruptions could impact the availability and accessibility of capital in markets for certain sectors and securities.OperationalIncreased severity of climate-related events could impact our ofce locations and disrupt our  systems, people and processes across our global footprint.ReputationGrowing stakeholder focus on corporate action to meet emissions reduction targets can result  in increased reputational risk and reduced client and employee loyalty, investor divestment and \\n impacts to client activity. \\nLegalClimate-related disclosures are increasingly important and climate-related litigation could also result from stranded assets, acute climate events or resulting market price declines. TCFD Appendix\\n66Climate-Risk Scenario AnalysisOur overall business structure, strategy and comprehensive risk management provide a strong foundation for \\n managing and mitigating these potential risks. However, climate change is highly complex and non-linear, with many \\nuncertainties. In addition, new data, tools, and expectations are continuously evolving. As such, we have a climate \\n change risk management framework, which includes stress testing based on an initial set of scenarios. As part of \\n ongoing implementation, we are undertaking further renement of the scenarios with the goal of improving their risk \\nmanagement benet.\\nAs a global nancial institution, we use a variety of stress-testing techniques to calculate the potential impact of a wide \\nrange of potential market moves. We perform stress testing on a regular basis to ensure a comprehensive analysis \\n of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks in anticipation of market events or conditions, which include climate \\nconsiderations. For climate stress testing, we perform both (i) transition risk stress tests on the value of our balance \\n sheet-related equity and credit assets, and (ii) physical risk stress tests on our global properties. The following is what \\n we have initially undertaken: \\n(i) Transition Risk Stress Test\\nTransition risk arises from changes to policy, technology and consumer preferences over time that reduce reliance on \\ncarbon-intensive products and services. The composition of industries, particularly in the energy sector, will change as \\na result of compliance with climate policy changes such as the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Since individual \\ncountries will implement decarbonization policies in different ways, changes to industries will also depend on where they \\nare located and how the policies evolve over time. Climate policy changes introduce nancial risks to nancial institutions \\nthat may own or nance companies whose value could be affected. To measure these risks, we perform transition risk \\nstress testing.\\nCurrently, we perform transition risk stress tests under two scenarios: 1) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is fully \\nimplemented by all countries; and 2) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is partially implemented in line with current \\npolicy plans. In implementing each scenario, we assume that a credible policy change is announced and that the market \\nconsequently adjusts credit ratings and prices of affected companies and trades. In each stress test, we estimate the \\nchange in credit ratings that would result from each policy change as well as the changes in equity and credit prices that \\nare consistent with those credit rating changes. We then reprice all affected assets on our balance sheet to measure the \\ntotal change in value that would result under each scenario.\\n(ii) Physical Risk Stress Test\\nPhysical risk arises from changes to the environment that are produced directly by the continuing concentration of GHGs \\nin the atmosphere and the consequent increases in temperature, precipitation, sea level and other environmental factors. \\nPhysical changes in the environment may affect the value of properties directly; an increase in sea level, coupled with \\nmore extreme precipitation and hurricanes, would affect the value of coastal properties, for example. But physical risks \\nmay also inuence the value of assets indirectly by reducing local economic growth, worsening health or lowering labor \\nproductivity. The magnitude of physical risks that manifest is linked to transition scenarios, since GHG emissions and their \\nresulting impacts will be determined by policy-driven mitigation measures. \\nIn our physical stress test, we examine the effect of heat stress, water stress, extreme precipitation, sea level rise, and \\nooding on our properties. The climate policy that we assume in our stress test is a high-emissions policy. We assume that \\nthe concentration of GHGs increases even more than expected under current policies and that therefore temperature and \\nother environmental risks worsen relative to business-as-usual expectations. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n67(iii) Next Steps\\nThese initial stress tests were helpful in understanding relative sensitivities and providing a starting point for further \\nrening the analysis. To that end, we are working to enhance our transition risk and physical risk stress tests along a \\nnumber of dimensions in order to improve their decision usefulness. In our transition risk stress test, we are examining \\nhow to increase its exibility so that we can run a wider range of scenarios that incorporate more varied policy changes. \\nSimilarly, in our physical risk stress tests, we are exploring how we might incorporate a wider range of policy changes, \\nsuch as full adherence to the Paris Agreement. We are also considering how to add more physical risks to our physical \\nstress test, such as wildres, and how to better estimate the effects of physical risks on asset values. More broadly, we \\nare investigating whether the transition risk and physical risk stress tests should be unied or whether it would be more \\nbenecial to keep them separate. \\nComprehensive Risk Management Approach Business Structure and Strategy: \\nAs a global nancial institution with a diverse set of businesses and clients, our business structure and strategy help us \\nmanage overall climate-related risks and increase our ability to participate in climate-related opportunities. \\n  \\nA signicant part of our client nancings in our Investment Banking\\n business are provided through our underwritten \\nofferings where we connect users of capital with investors versus holding nancings on our balance sheet. For \\nunderwritings, how we perform due diligence, make business selection decisions and provide relevant disclosures \\n are critical and form part of our comprehensive risk management approach.\\n  \\nOur Asset Management\\n and Consumer & Wealth Management\\n businesses largely relate to client assets and are integrating ESG considerations, including climate-related strategies for our clients, as well as taking into account factors \\nthat could be material in valuing performance and risk, such as those relating to climate change.\\n  \\nOur Global Markets\\n business is highly diversied and managed in a way that reects real-time information and shifts \\n in potential risks. Given this current business mix and structure, and based on our initial stress tests, the direct balance sheet impacts \\nfrom climate change are relatively modest. However, our ability to effectively manage climate risks and opportunities is \\nimportant across our businesses in serving our clients and managing and protecting existing pools of assets while \\n creating opportunities for further growth.\\nBusiness Activities: \\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have a well-established enterprise \\nrisk management (ERM) framework, which is ultimately overseen by our Board. The ERM framework employs a \\ncomprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and it is designed to enable robust risk management processes \\nthrough which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our business activities. \\nAs part of our risk management approach, we have rmwide policy guidelines and dedicated teams that support business \\nselection and review processes:\\nTCFD Appendix\\n68  \\nFirmwide policy guidelines\\n for carbon-intensive sectors and activities, such as coal-red power generation, palm \\n oil, and oil & gas are included in our Environmental Policy Framework\\n (EPF). The EPF was updated in December \\n 2019 to restrict certain carbon-related business activities and to strengthen our work with clients to help them with \\n their climate transition.   \\nUpfront business selection and due diligence processes\\n that include 14 key sector and cross-sector \\nguidelines, and worst-case-loss calculations for physical commodities in certain carbon-intensive sectors, complement the EPF. These \\nguidelines and tools are leveraged across the various activities of the rm at the business selection stage and through \\ndesignated committee review processes. There are escalation mechanisms and protocols undertaken at each stage. \\nWhere relevant, we also incorporate extreme weather and ooding event probability into worst-case-loss calculations \\n for certain transactions. See \\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\\n for more information. \\n  \\nRisk Identication and Scenario Design\\n, which is a periodic process that we undertake to review the materiality of \\nevolving risks in our business activities over a two-year forward-looking horizon, includes the assessment of impact from \\nclimate change.\\nIn addition, our ongoing risk monitoring from credit, liquidity, and market risk management teams, mark-to-market portfolio \\nvaluations, dynamic hedging, and insurance requirements where relevant, enables overall position management and \\nexposure reduction where potential material risks are identied.\\nOperations: \\nFor our physical assets, the Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee oversees business continuity planning \\nand crisis management efforts, including planning for climate-related risks. The committee oversees efforts related to:\\n  \\nRegular resiliency reviews \\n  \\nComprehensive infrastructure and business continuity assessments \\n Overall real estate site selection and management strategy\\n  \\nBusiness Continuity Planning and remote access infrastructure\\nWe also consider such risks through all stages of our corporate real estate strategy, from site selection and building design \\nto occupancy and facilities management. Within our operations, we utilize various metrics and dashboards to prioritize and \\ntrack risks that pose a threat to the health and safety of our employees or to the rms critical infrastructure assets that \\nsupport core business functions.TCFD Appendix\\n69Metrics and Targets\\nBusiness Opportunities:\\n The rm has had a long-standing commitment to harnessing market solutions to address climate \\nchange. One of the key ways we have been doing this is by mobilizing capital to scale clean energy, given energy is the \\nlargest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Clean energy also brings benets of energy diversication and security, \\ntechnology innovation, and green jobs, as well as health benets. Since 2006, we have mobilized over $115 billion in clean \\nenergy nancing and investments.\\nGoing forward, we have a more expansive goal to deploy $750 billion in sustainable nance over the next 10 years, with \\n a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth. Please refer to our \\nSustainability Report\\n for more information about our \\nSustainable Finance Goals.\\nOperations and GHG Emissions:\\n To ensure we remain a leader in implementing sustainability practices and reducing \\noperational risk, our Services Division is committed to minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment and \\nadopting best practices. We have been carbon neutral across our global operations and business travel since 2015, and \\nare progressing on our 2020 operational goals. Additionally, alongside the sustainable nance target, we announced new \\noperational goals for 2025, with a focus on strategic, collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation.\\n See Our Operational Impact.We currently measure, disclose and reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our own activities, and also \\n disclose Scope 3 emissions related to business travel. See \\npage 47 for our latest GHG emissions and energy use data \\n for 2019. \\nTCFD Appendix\\n70The Path Forward This report is the rst step in our application of TCFD recommendations. Goldman Sachs is committed to continuing \\nour work with various stakeholders, including clients, shareholders, peer banks and other key constituents to improve \\nmethodologies on climate-related risk analysis and disclosures and to furthering climate-related opportunities to \\nfacilitate the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy. Per the TCFD recommendations, which acknowledge that \\nimplementation is a journey that will evolve over time, we will continue to rene our climate initiatives and disclosure in a \\nway that progresses our ability to more effectively manage risk-and-capture strategic growth opportunities while helping \\nto inform the broader market. We look forward to continuing our engagement on this important topic, and leveraging the \\nbreadth of our businesses to navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nThis document is not a product of Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.

Employee satisfaction is up, reecting an \\nimprovement in the way we engage with and \\nsupport our people. We have improved the way \\n we listen to customers and acted on that feedback, \\nand we have simplied our governance structures \\nto create clearer and stronger lines of authority. \\n We have also accelerated our support for the \\nlow-carbon transition.\\nYet for all our strides, there are areas where we can \\nand must do better. Our senior leadership teams \\nare still not diverse enough. Many of our customers \\nstill nd it too dicult to bank with us. On conduct, \\nwe have more to do in adapting to changing \\nsocietal expectations. \\nAddressing these aspects of our performance \\n will take time. There are no quick or easy xes. \\n But where there is work to be done, we will do \\n so with urgency, conviction and clear purpose. \\nAs Group Chief Executive, my overriding priority \\n is to create stronger relationships with all our \\nstakeholders  and it is part of our ambition to \\ncreate what we call the healthiest human system \\n in our industry. If we can do that, and live up to \\n our wider societal obligations, then we believe \\n we will materially improve all aspects of HSBCs \\nperformance and safeguard the future of the \\norganisation for generations to come. \\nAll of you reading this are part of that ambition. \\nYour feedback and your views are important to \\n us. We will continue to take them into account, \\n and to listen, learn and act. \\nI hope you nd the report useful. \\n John Flint\\nGroup Chief Executive\\nLiving up to our wider societal obligations \\n has always been part of HSBCs culture and \\nidentity. Our success over 154 years has been \\nfounded on our ability to build strong and trusted \\nrelationships not just with our customers, but \\n with the communities and other stakeholders \\n we serve all over the world. \\nWe recognise that there have been times, \\nparticularly in the recent past, where we have \\nfailed to meet the standards expected of us.\\nSocietal expectations are changing, and investors \\nare placing increasing importance on the wider \\nimpact businesses have on people and the planet. \\nSo over the past few years we have taken steps \\n to improve all aspects of our non-nancial \\nperformance, and to live up to the duty of \\n care we have to all our stakeholders today. \\nThis \\nESG Update\\n  the fourth we have produced \\n shines a light on our progress. It covers all the \\nusual areas, from corporate governance and our \\nenvironmental impact, to customer satisfaction \\n and our approach to conduct. We are continuing \\n to meet our reporting obligations under the terms \\nof the UN Global Compact and renewing our \\ncommitment to the Compacts principles.\\n \\nOur success over 154 years has been \\n founded on our ability to build strong \\n and trusted relationships.\\n2Overview\\n\\n\\n\\nHSBC at a glance\\nOur global reach\\nOur global businesses\\nAbout HSBC\\nHSBC is one of the worlds largest banking and nancial services organisations.

Return to growth and value creation \\nWe entered the next phase of our strategy in 2018, focused on growth and creating value for our stakeholders. In our June 2018 \\nStrategy Update\\n we outlined eight strategic priorities to deliver growth, improve returns, empower our people, and enhance our \\ncustomer experience.

These human \\nconnections are complex \\n and overlap. Many of our \\nemployees are customers \\n and shareholders, while our \\nbusiness customers are often \\nsuppliers. We exist to serve, \\ncreating value for our \\ncustomers and shareholders. \\nOur size and global reach \\nmean our actions can have \\n a signicant impact, which \\n is why we want to create \\n the healthiest human system \\nin nancial services to help \\nenable our business strategy.\\nWe listen to our stakeholders in a number of dierent ways, \\nfrom employee and customer surveys to client meetings. \\nInvestors tell us what matters to them in the annual ESG \\ninvestor survey and in qualitative assessments during investor \\nmeetings. We are also informed by stock exchange listing \\n and disclosure rules in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.\\nWe use this information to identify what issues are material \\n to our stakeholders, taking into account the nature of our \\nbusiness. In line with the provisions of the ESG Guide, \\n an issue is considered to be material when management \\ndetermines that it has become suciently important to \\n our stakeholders that it should be publicly reported.\\nManagement tables material issues for discussion at the \\n ESG Steering Committee and other relevant governance \\nforums. We use these themes and concerns as a guide \\n for our \\nESG Update\\n. Further information about the ESG \\nSteering Committee is included in the Ensuring strong \\ncorporate governance section of the report on page 40. \\nWe acknowledge that material issues evolve over time, \\n and we will continue to assess them to ensure we remain \\ncurrent in our approach and communications. \\n5\\nOur approach \\nReporting on material issues in an open \\n and transparent way is key to meeting \\n the expectations of our stakeholders. \\nOur ESG approach\\n We support the global transition to the \\nlow-carbon economy through our own \\nsustainable operations and by supporting \\nour customers with their transition.\\n We maintain robust climate-related risk \\nmanagement, covering sensitive sectors, \\nsuch as energy, palm oil and forestry.\\n We aim to maintain high standards \\n of governance across all geographies.\\n We are committed to protecting our \\ncustomers and communities through \\nnancial crime risk management and \\ncybersecurity due diligence.\\nEnvironmental\\nSocial\\nGovernance\\nExamples:\\n In our ambition to provide $100bn of sustainable nancing, \\nfacilitation and investment by 2025, we have delivered \\n a cumulative total of $28.5bn since 2017, with external \\nassurance of this number provided by PwC using ISAE \\n3000. The full assurance statement is included on page 28.\\n We are a signatory to the Financial Stability Board \\n Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. \\n The second year disclosure is available on page 30.\\nExamples:\\n During 2018, we concentrated on the completion of the \\n nal elements of our Global Standards programme, which \\n is designed to ensure the management of nancial crime \\ncompliance is embedded in our day-to-day management \\n and governance.\\n We are committed to applying both the letter and spirit \\n of the law in all the territories in which we operate.\\nExamples:\\n In this report, we publish customer information for each of \\nour global businesses, including spotlights on conduct. This \\nincludes information on the strengthening of our controls, \\nand achieving fair outcomes for customers and culture.\\n Our employee surveys give us invaluable insight into our \\npeople. Results in 2018 show that 74% feel able to speak \\n up when they see behaviour that they consider to be wrong.\\n We are building a diverse workforce and have set a target \\n of 30% women holding senior leadership roles by 2020. \\nCurrently 28% of our senior leaders are women, so while \\n we are making progress we recognise there is still room \\n for improvement.\\nOur conduct approach\\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility for good conduct \\nthrough the delivery of fair outcomes for customers and \\nbehaving in a way that protects nancial markets integrity. \\n We have therefore implemented a conduct framework \\ndescribing the outcomes that must be delivered across the \\nGroup and which in turn form a key component of our risk \\nmanagement framework. This means that our decisions should \\nconsider the impact on customers and markets. In addition, \\ndelivery of the required Group values and conduct behaviours \\ncontinues to be considered in performance management \\n for our people across the Group. Our conduct is overseen \\n by senior risk and executive committees within each of our \\nbusinesses, functions and HSBC Operations Services and \\nTechnology. The Board maintains oversight of conduct \\n matters through the Group Risk Committee. \\n We aim to grow in a way that puts the \\ncustomer at the centre.\\n We want to create the healthiest human \\nsystem in our industry. We are working to \\ncreate the right environment so everyone \\ncan full their potential.\\n We are focusing on diversity and inclusion \\nin our workforce, and we are striving to \\nput the customer at the heart of everything \\nwe do.\\n6Overview\\n\\n Customers\\nWe aim to grow in a way that puts the \\n customer at the centre by improving \\n performance with digital enhancements \\n while maintaining nancial crime standards. \\nAt a glance\\nOur relationship\\nOur purpose is to be where the growth is, connecting \\ncustomers to opportunities. We help enable businesses \\n to thrive and economies to prosper, helping people full \\n their hopes and dreams and realise their ambitions. \\nWe create value by providing the products and services \\n our customers need, and aim to do so in a way that ts \\nseamlessly into their lives. This helps us to build long-lasting \\nrelationships with our customers. We maintain trust by \\nstriving to protect our customers data and information, \\n and delivering fair outcomes for them  and if things \\n go wrong, we need to address complaints in a timely \\nmanner. Operating with high standards of conduct is \\n central to our long-term success and underpins our \\n ability to serve our customers.\\nIn this section we report on our customers as four \\n distinct groups: our retail customers medium and large-\\nsized corporate customers global and institutional \\ncustomers and high net worth customers. These groups \\n  are serviced by our four global businesses respectively: \\nRetail Banking and \\nWealth Management \\n(RBWM)\\nCommercial Banking \\n(CMB)\\nGlobal Banking and \\nMarkets (GB&M)\\nGlobal Private \\n Banking (GPB)\\nWe help 38 million customers \\nacross the world to manage \\ntheir nances, buy their \\nhomes, and save and invest \\n for the future.\\nOur HSBC Premier and \\nAdvance propositions are \\naimed at mass auent and \\nemerging auent customers \\nwho value international \\nconnectivity. For customers \\nwith simpler banking needs, \\nwe oer a full range of \\nproducts and services \\nreecting local requirements. \\nWe support approximately \\n 1.5 million business customers \\nin 53 countries and territories, \\nranging from small enterprises \\nfocused primarily on their \\ndomestic markets, through \\n to large companies \\n operating globally.\\nOur services include working \\ncapital, term loans, payment \\nservices and international \\ntrade facilitation, as well as \\nexpertise in mergers and \\nacquisitions, and access \\n to nancial markets.\\nWe serve approximately \\n 4,100 clients in more than 50 \\ncountries and territories. We \\nsupport major government, \\ncorporate and institutional \\nclients worldwide.\\nOur product specialists \\ncontinue to deliver a \\ncomprehensive range of \\ntransaction banking, nancing, \\nadvisory, capital markets and \\nrisk management services. \\nWe serve high net worth \\n and ultra high net worth \\nindividuals and families, \\nincluding those with \\ninternational banking needs.\\nServices provided include \\nInvestment Management, \\nwhich includes advisory \\n and brokerage services, \\n and Private Wealth Solutions, \\nwhich comprises trusts and \\nestate planning, to protect \\n and preserve wealth for \\n future generations.\\n7\\nOur Retail Banking and Wealth \\nManagement customers \\nHow we listen to our customers\\nthe same levels or improved compared \\n with last year.We have focused on \\nimproving our customer service training and \\nproviding simpler processes with enhanced \\ntechnology. We also launched our Universal \\nBanker programme in ve markets, \\n which helps train our people to be digitally \\nequipped, and empowers them to resolve \\nmore queries themselves. Over 4,000 \\nemployees are now Universal Bankers. \\n Less positively, the satisfaction score of \\n our US contact centres fell and overall \\ncomplaints rose, driven by a signicant \\noverhaul of the banking platform, which \\nled to increased call volumes and customer \\nwait times. We addressed this through \\nincreasing headcount and expanding our \\nchatbot capabilities.\\nWe listen to our customers in a number \\n of dierent ways, including through our \\ninteractions with them, surveys, social \\nmedia and from their complaints. We use \\nthese insights to improve our services. \\nCustomer recommendation \\nIn 2018, we surveyed more than two million \\ncustomers on their likelihood to recommend \\nHSBC to others and their satisfaction \\n with our services. We have made some \\nprogress, with recommendation scores \\nimproving in the majority of markets. More \\ncustomers recommended us for being \\neasily accessible, oering good digital \\nservices,and our overall customer service. \\nHowever, our savings accounts remain an \\narea of dissatisfaction, with more customers \\ntelling us they are seeking competitive rates \\nand charges. In the UK, the First Direct \\nbrand ranked rst for mobile banking \\nservices and second overall in the \\nCompetition and Markets Authority \\nrankings in 2018, where banks were scored \\nby customers on the quality of service.\\nIn 2018, we changed the way we \\n report customer recommendation by \\nbroadening the range of customers we \\nsurvey, and by looking at the full range of \\nscores provided. We believe this provides \\n a more representative and complete \\nperspective on the customer service \\n we oer relative to the market. \\nCustomer satisfaction \\nCustomer satisfaction in our online banking \\nservices rose in some of our key markets in \\n2018, following signicant declines in the \\nprevious year. The decline in satisfaction in \\n2017 came after the launch of a new online \\nbanking system and enhanced security \\nfeatures. The new platform should help \\nenable us to roll out new digital services at \\na faster pace while keeping our customers \\nsafe. However, we saw a drop in customer \\nsatisfaction as customers learned how to \\nuse the new service. By listening to our \\ncustomers, we improved the way we \\ncommunicated changes and xed a \\nnumber of the issues that were causing \\n the most frustration, such as login and \\npayments.

We have responded with new \\ninitiatives to improve the experience such \\nas adding real-time customer assistance \\ncapabilities, and plan to continue \\nenhancements to our capabilities. In 2018, \\nwe focused our eorts on upgrading our \\nmobile banking experience where we have \\nseen the highest growth in customer \\nusage.

Apples Touch ID is now live in 18 markets and HSBC Voice ID \\n is in ve markets. Last year, 80% of customer transactions were conducted via mobile or online channels. More than 30% \\n of loans, cards and deposits sales were through digital channels.\\nIn the UK, we trained our front-line people to become more digitally procient. In branch or on the phone, they can show \\ncustomers how to complete tasks digitally. Last year, 85% of new customers opened accounts through a supported \\n digital experience.\\nMaking our \\n processes easier\\nIn the UK, we are simplifying our mortgage process. Applications can be approved within 10 days with the help of \\nautomatic valuations, improved credit policies and increased underwriter availability.\\nTo make investing more accessible, we equipped our branch employees in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore \\nwith mobile tablets, and launched an online nancial health check. Customers can now understand their investment \\noptions in their own time, without a specialist appointment. For more information on our digital enhancements, please \\n see Our investment in technology on page 18.\\nMaking it easy to \\nunderstand us and \\n our fees and charges\\nIn Singapore, we simplied our mortgage application forms and oer letters, so customers can be clear about their \\nrepayment schedule, terms and conditions, and fees and charges. \\nThrough digital messaging we are raising customer awareness around overdrafts in the UK, Hong Kong, France and the \\n US. In the UK, we expanded the volume of overdraft alerts, which we rst introduced in 2017, sending more than 26 million \\nalerts in 2018 to help customers save money. Over half (56%) of customers who receive an alert pay in funds to avoid \\ncharges. To help even more customers avoid fees, we are introducing services like our Connected Money app, which \\n helps people keep track of their spending (see page 11).\\nWhen things go wrong\\nWe aim to ensure customers complaints \\nare recorded so we can understand what \\nwent wrong and why, and then act upon \\nthe feedback. Complaints are monitored \\nand reported to governance forums. \\nSenior executives are measured against \\ncomplaint-handling performance. \\nThe way we handle complaints and how \\nfast we respond is important to us and our \\ncustomers. In 2018, we resolved 77% of \\ncomplaints on the same or next working \\nday, and 86% within ve working days, \\nexcluding UK complaints related to \\npayment protection insurance (PPI). \\n The most common complaints related to \\nprocess and procedures (39%), service \\n(25%), and fees and charges (9%).\\nIn 2018, we received approximately 1.2 \\nmillion complaints from retail customers \\n in our large markets referenced in the \\nadjacent table, a 16% increase compared \\nwith 2017, primarily driven by the UK and \\nMexico. The increase in UK complaints \\nmainly related to PPI, which is consistent \\nacross the UK industry, and to digital \\nregistration issues. An improvement \\nprogramme for non-PPI complaints was \\nintroduced in 2018, resulting in complaint \\nvolumes declining in the fourth quarter. Our \\nbusiness in Mexico experienced an increase \\nin complaints due to the prevalence of \\nonline fraud transactions leading to service \\ninterruption. We provided refunds to the \\ncustomers and strengthened our fraud \\ncontrol measures, as well as launching a \\ncard control app that allows customers to \\nmanage deactivating controls on online \\ncard usage. As of September 2018, the \\nFinancial Services Consumers Protection \\nBureau in Mexico ranked HSBC as the best \\nbank among the seven largest banks for \\ncomplaint resolution and quality of service \\non their Customer Care Performance Index. \\nComplaints at our UAE business fell 18%, \\nbut remained relatively high. Complaints \\nwere primarily due to manual processes, \\nservice delays, sta knowledge and clarity \\nof our communication to customers. These \\ncontinue to be addressed through a \\ncustomer experience programme.\\n1. \\n  \\nA complaint is dened as any expression \\n of dissatisfaction, whether upheld or not, from \\n (or on behalf of) a former, existing or prospective \\ncustomer relating to the provision of, or failure to \\nprovide, a specic product or service activity.\\nRBWM complaint volumes\\nComplaints per 1,000 \\ncustomers per month\\n12018\\n2017\\nUK4.0\\n3.3\\nHong Kong\\n0.5 \\n 0.7\\nFrance\\n4.7\\n6.0\\nUS3.9\\n3.4\\nCanada\\n3.1\\n2.7\\nMexico\\n5.3\\n4.5\\nSingapore\\n1.4\\n1.6\\nMalaysia\\n0.4\\n0.5\\nMainland China\\n0.7\\n0.7\\nUAE\\n5.6\\n6.8\\n9Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nWe recognise we have a responsibility \\n to deliver fair outcomes for our retail \\ncustomers and behave in a way that \\nprotects nancial market integrity. We \\nmanage this through a range of activities, \\nfrom working to ensure products are \\ndesigned fairly to endeavouring to \\n meet customers nancial needs. \\nWe have put in place clear policies, \\nframeworks and governance to protect \\n our customers. Our conduct and risk \\nframeworks describe the outcomes that \\nmust be delivered across the Group. In \\nperformance management, we consider \\nwhether behaviour is in line with our \\nvalues. Conduct is overseen by senior risk \\nand executive committees, while the Board \\nmaintains oversight of conduct matters \\nthrough the Group Risk Committee. \\nProduct design and fair value \\nGood product design helps provide the \\nright outcomes for our customers. We \\nprovide training through the Product \\nManagement Academy. To date, more \\nthan 1,000 of our people have completed \\ntraining on topics including customer \\ninsight, customer-focused design, \\n making communications simple, product \\ndevelopment, management oversight \\n and governance. \\nCustomer insight is the foundation of \\n the design process, so we work with \\ncustomer research groups to co-create \\nsolutions. This involves checking in \\n with customer panels and user labs \\nthroughout the process to understand \\ncustomer reaction, so we can dynamically \\nadapt designs to meet changing needs. \\nIn Mexico, we launched our Stilo \\n banking service, which includes a money \\nmanagement tips app, lling a gap in \\nservice that our customers had told us \\nabout. In Hong Kong, we worked with \\nmore than 3,000 customers to design \\n and test our PayMe services and features \\nbefore launching them, including peer-to-\\npeer payments for customers and \\nnon-customers. PayMe reached a \\nmilestone of approximately 1.5 million \\nusers in 2018. \\nThe range of products oered in our \\nmarkets is managed globally. Any newly \\ndeveloped product goes through a \\nreview process with global oversight for \\ndierent or complex products. During \\nthis process, products are tested to help \\nensure they are suitable and oer fair \\nvalue to customers.\\nOngoing monitoring is also a critical \\ncomponent of our product governance \\nprogramme. Regular in-depth reviews \\nrecognise a product or service may \\nbecome unsuitable over a period of time, \\nwhether it is after a signicant event \\n or following an accumulation of \\n multiple changes.\\nProduct design key principles:\\nOur products should remain relevant \\n in each country they are oered.\\nWe oer a consistent, simple and \\ncarefully selected range of products.\\nWe act on feedback from customers \\n to provide better and more accessible \\nproducts/services. \\nProducts that no longer meet our \\n high standards or customer needs \\n are withdrawn from sale.\\nWe also conduct regular product reviews \\nand fair value assessments in each of the \\nmarkets we operate in, to help ensure we \\ndeliver fair value.\\nPricing key principles:\\nAll products and services must meet \\n a minimum set of design standards.\\nWe carry out regular comparisons \\n of HSBC pricing with those of local \\ncompetitors and with our own fair \\n value standards, considering the total \\ncharges and features of a product.\\nWe review the usage levels of product \\nfeatures to assess if customers \\nbehaviours and responses demonstrate \\nthey are receiving value.\\nOversight and governance of our \\n fair value assessments and product \\nsafety is provided by the Global Wealth \\nManagement Oversight Committee, \\nchaired by the Global Head of Wealth \\nProducts, and the Retail Banking \\nManagement Committee, chaired \\n by the Global Head of Retail Products. \\nThe RBWM Global Incentive Committee, \\nwhich reports to the Chief Executive \\nOcer of RBWM, oversees front-line \\nemployee incentives.\\nMeeting our customers needs\\nIn order to meet customers needs \\neectively, we have robust oversight of \\nthe sales process, including reviewing \\nthe suitability of the products we oer, \\nsales quality monitoring, and how we \\nincentivise our sta.\\nWe consider our customers nancial \\nneeds and personal circumstances to \\nassist us in oering suitable product \\nrecommendations. This is achieved \\nthrough: \\n a globally consistent methodology \\n to rate the riskiness of investment \\nproducts, which is customised for \\n local regulatory requirements\\n a robust customer risk proling \\nmethodology to help assess \\ncustomers nancial objectives, \\nattitude towards risk, nancial ability \\n to bear investment risk and their \\nknowledge and experience\\n goal projection tools and calculators \\n to help customers plan for their future \\nin line with their overall investment \\nobjectives and \\n consistent global advisory standards to \\nfollow when we make recommendations \\nto our customers, while taking into \\naccount local regulations.\\nFrom a service perspective, our goal\\n is to empower our people to resolve \\nissues. In the UK, we embedded a \\nprogramme to give front-line employees \\na means to raise and contribute towards \\nsolving customer issues and to escalate \\nSpotlight: Conduct\\n10Customers | \\nOur\\n Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nlarger issues to executive management. \\nSince introducing the programme in \\n late 2017, over 8,000 issues have been \\nraised, and in 2018 more than 6,500 \\n were resolved. \\nSales quality\\nTo assure the quality of our sales process \\nand employees behaviour in each of our \\nmarkets, we either conduct a mystery \\nshopping programme or a sales quality \\nprogramme, or both.Issues identied are \\ntreated seriously. Action is taken to help \\nachieve a fair outcome for customers.\\nWhere concerns are found, we will \\ncontact the customer to explain and \\nremediate. Depending on the severity \\n of the issue, the relevant employee will \\nbe given enhanced training to improve \\ntheir behaviour and they may become \\nineligible for an incentive reward \\npayment.Where a case of misconduct \\noccurs, disciplinary action may be \\n taken, which can lead to dismissal. \\nFront-line employee incentives\\nIn 2013, we changed our front-line \\nincentives to create a discretionary \\nframework rather than a straight formula \\nbetween sales and reward. Our people \\nare now recognised for demonstrating \\nour values and behaviours as well as \\nmeeting customers needs through \\nproducts and services. The framework \\nexists to recognise our front-line \\nemployees who go above and beyond \\n for the customer, to deliver fair outcomes \\nand support the sustainable growth of \\nour business.\\nAligned to our customer experience \\nstandards, the incentive framework \\nassesses how our people listen to our \\ncustomers to understand their needs \\n so that they can provide appropriate \\nsolutions. Should an individual \\ndemonstrate behaviours that do not \\n align with our core values, there is a \\ndisciplinary process that again can \\n aect reward payments.\\nBuilding nancial capability \\nDelivering fair outcomes for customers \\nalso involves providing tools and content \\nthat help customers have the condence \\nand competence to make the most of \\ntheir money. In 2018, we made public \\ncommitments around building nancial \\ncapability, and we took a number of \\nactions to deliver on these commitments:\\n In the UK, we launched the HSBC \\nConnected Money app, which helps \\nusers see all their banking relationships \\nin one place and keep track of how \\n they spend their money. It has been \\ndownloaded 240,000 times. One \\n recent new feature allows users to \\n keep track of savings goals using \\n virtual savings pots.\\n We introduced card control features \\n in the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico, \\n so customers can control their \\n card spending and receive real-time \\nalerts on their activity. In Mexico, \\ncustomers can set spending limits \\n and block spending categories, \\n such as online shopping and \\nentertainment, including gambling.\\n \\nFor further details on how we support \\n building nancial capability and inclusion, \\n see pages 34 and 44.\\nManaging fraud\\nFraudulent activities are a risk and \\n a concern for our customers. We \\n are committed to mitigating and \\nreducing their impact through a \\n range of actions, including new fraud \\nprevention systems, improvements to \\nour internal processes and procedures, \\nas well as communications to raise \\nawareness. We introduced an automated \\ncustomer contact solution, which uses \\ntwo-way SMS messaging, in the second \\nhalf of 2018. Since its introduction, \\naround 4,000 customers per day are \\n able to respond instantly to our fraud \\nenquiries to either unblock their card \\n or report fraud. Approximately half of \\n all card fraud-related queries are now \\nresolved without the need of a phone \\nconversation, which has saved \\ncustomers approximately 87,000 calls \\nevery month. We plan to introduce this \\n service to more of our customers \\nthroughout 2019.\\nOperational resilience \\nHSBC invests in the reliability and \\nresilience of our systems to help prevent \\ndisruption to customers. During 2018, \\n we continued to upgrade our IT systems, \\nsimplifying our service provision and \\nreplacing older IT infrastructure and \\napplications. These enhancements led \\n to continued global improvements in \\nservice availability during the year for \\nboth our customers and employees.\\n \\nFor further details on how we aim to maintain \\nand continually improve our operational \\nresilience capability, see page 19.\\nSpotlight: Conduct \\ncontinued\\n11Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\\n\\nOur Commercial Banking\\n customers \\nHow we listen to our customers\\nActing on feedback\\nWe are committed to improving customer \\nsatisfaction for all our business customers, \\nfrom start-ups to large corporates.\\nWe have introduced additional governance \\nto embed a customer-led approach into \\nour decision making. In 2018, we created \\nthe new role of Global Head of Customer \\nExperience, and appointed customer \\nchampions in key business areas. \\nNew tools have been introduced to help \\nus understand our customers. These \\ninclude customer journey mapping, which \\naims to take a holistic approach to assess \\ncustomers current experiences and \\ndesign ideal ones. More than 350 of our \\npeople globally have been trained in its \\nuse. New articial intelligence (AI) tools \\nused by our insight and analytics teams \\nalso allow us to scrutinise more open-\\nended feedback from customers quickly \\nand accurately.\\nCustomer satisfaction\\nWe use syndicated research, feedback \\nfrom social media, and operational data \\nto help us identify what areas are most \\nimportant to our customers, and where \\nour performance could be improved. \\nAreas of focus include the ease and \\nspeed of the account opening process, \\nour eciency in dealing with queries \\n and our range of products. \\nWe still have some way to go to achieve \\nour ambitions, but our rank position against \\ncompetitors for customer satisfaction either \\nremained at or improved compared with \\nlast year in seven of our eight key markets.\\n1Moments of Truth\\nIn 2018, we fully embedded our Moments \\nof Truth programme, surveys which allow \\nus to continually capture feedback from \\ncustomers about interactions we know are \\nimportant to them. We have surveyed over \\n18,000 customers across 40 markets and \\nhave driven improvements through more \\nthan 100 actions taken to address the \\nfeedback. Key performance metrics across \\nall these key events, such as opening \\n an account, calling our contact centres, \\nsetting up internet banking, applying for \\ncredit or changing relationship manager, \\nhave improved in 2018. We actively \\nreview the interactions we measure to \\nmake sure we continue to focus on the \\nissues that matter most to our customers. \\nListening to customers and acting on their feedback has helped us to drive improvements to the customer experience. \\n Here are some of the main issues raised and how we responded.\\nArea of focus\\nAction\\nImproving the \\n ease and speed of \\naccount opening\\nIn the UK, we created a new welcome journey for small businesses. This resulted in improved customer satisfaction \\nand increased use of self-service digital tools. In France, we sped up the opening of accounts by simplifying the \\nprocess. In Singapore, new customers are now assigned a single point of contact to help them. A customised video \\nalso introduces customers to their service team and helps them to get started with online banking. \\nCustomer query \\nhandling\\nWe want to make sure our people are fully equipped to answer customer enquiries eciently and eectively. We \\nprovided additional training for customer service managers in our Global Trade and Receivables Finance business \\n in Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as for our HSBCnet telephone teams to improve their technical and soft skills. \\n In the UK, a query escalation process was introduced to improve our ability to resolve queries quickly and accurately. \\nEasy channels \\n to communicate \\nfeedback\\nIn order to help make sure our products and services meet customers needs, we have more than 200 customers \\n as active members of online panels in the UK, Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia, UAE, Mexico and the US. These \\nprovide fast feedback, allowing us to test changes directly with customers. In 2018, they helped us redesign our online \\nbanking platform and provided input into developments around integration of third-party accounting software.\\nCase study: Customer-centric \\npayments review\\nA customer-centric review was \\nlaunched to improve the eciency \\n of our payment processing across \\nAsia-Pacic. We created a smoother \\nauthentication process through \\n a one-time password issued \\n to customers by text message. \\n This avoided three authentication \\nquestions, which customers told \\n us were dicult to use. Customer \\nqueries are now handled faster by \\ngiving wider access to the payment \\nsystems to our employees. These \\nchanges contributed towards a \\n 70% reduction of payments-related \\ncomplaints, from their highest point \\n in 2017, and a fall in average call \\nhandling time from 11 to seven minutes.\\n1. \\n Eight key markets: Hong Kong, UK, Pearl River Delta, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Customer satisfaction metrics for Pearl River Delta will \\nbe available from 2019. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and UAE, CMB performance in 2017 is based on the bank that the customer denes as their \\nmain bank, while CMB performance for these markets in 2018 is based on the bank that the customer denes as the most important. Surveys are based on a \\nrelevant and representative subset of the market. Data provided by RFi Group, Kantar and another third-party provider.\\n12Customers\\n\\nWhen things go wrong\\nWe support our people to help make \\n sure they handle customer complaints \\neectively, with a training module \\navailable to all relevant employees. \\n A new global complaints management \\nprocedure was delivered in the rst \\nquarter of 2019 to help make sure we \\ncontinue to manage complaints in an \\nequitable and timely way, in an eort \\n to provide eective and fair outcomes \\n for our customers.\\nIn 2018, we resolved a total of 77,892 \\ncorporate customer complaints, which \\nwas a 35% year-on-year increase, with \\n81% coming from customers in the UK, \\n3% in France and 2% in the US. \\nWe have stepped up our nancial crime \\nprevention procedures due to increased \\nscrutiny in this area, but as a result this \\nhas led to increased complaints from \\n our customers, representing more than \\n a quarter (27%) of total complaints. \\nDissatisfaction was often due to requests \\nfor additional personal and business \\ninformation to help us guard against \\n fraud and money laundering. Without \\nthose details, services were sometimes \\nrestricted and, in certain circumstances, \\naccounts were closed. After reviewing \\ncustomer communications, we have \\nimproved the content and layout of letters, \\nmaking the process clearer and simpler.\\nOperational complaints were the \\n second highest in volume (25% of total \\ncomplaints), reecting the most frequent \\ncustomer transactions. Improvements in \\nthe payment processes and the way \\n we handle queries reduced complaints \\nsignicantly in Asia-Pacic. We are keen \\nto learn from these events to improve \\ncustomer experience in other markets.\\nAccount opening complaints reected \\n the third largest in volume (7% of total \\ncomplaints).

To help make sure all \\n our products meet customer needs, \\n we have a rigorous governance and \\n approval process for any new product \\n or signicant changes to existing ones. \\nWe operate sales outcome testing \\n in 12 key markets designed to ensure \\ncustomers have understood the features \\nof their chosen products, such as pricing, \\nmechanics, risk and benets. In 2018, \\n we identied 132 issues through the \\nCMB outcome testing programme, such \\nas documentation, sales process, and \\npricing issues. Actions are underway to \\naddress these issues.\\nWe recognise it is important to provide \\nour products at a fair price and in a \\ntransparent way. Since late 2017, an \\nexecutive pricing steering committee \\n has been improving our existing pricing \\nframework to help make sure we \\n price products and services fairly, \\ncommunicate transparently, and have \\nrobust controls in place. Following our \\nfocused eorts, complaints around fees \\nand charges have fallen by 20% over \\n the last two years.\\nWe have put a strong emphasis on \\ncommunicating to our people on how \\n we should behave. We broadcast videos \\nof senior leaders speaking about what \\nconduct means to them and why it is \\nimportant. We feature examples of \\nemployees making the right decisions \\n in the interests of customers in global \\nemployee communications. Countries, \\nregions and global operations all held \\nconduct-themed workshops, informal \\nExchange sessions and town halls. \\n Spotlight: Conduct\\nThis has resulted in a signicant input \\n of ideas and concerns that have allowed \\nour leaders to shape their own conduct \\nagendas and communications. For \\nfurther details of our Exchange forums, \\nsee the Employees section on page 22. \\nThe scorecards for front-line employees \\nare now balanced with a maximum \\n of 50% being related to performance. \\n We are increasingly seeing instances of \\nrole model behaviours driving upward \\nadjustments in variable pay from 1% \\n in 2015 to 8% in 2017.\\nFraud is a growing problem and we strive \\nto protect our customers from nancial \\ncrime. In Mexico, we introduced training \\nfor our relationship managers focused \\n on business email compromise and \\nmalware fraud so they can pass on this \\nknowledge to customers and take the \\nright action if a customer is aected.\\nan increase in complaints. In France, \\n rapid business growth during early 2018 \\nresulted in higher than expected account \\nopening requests, increasing the time \\ntaken to open accounts. Additional \\nresources were employed and changes \\nimplemented to streamline the process, \\nresulting in a reduction in complaints later \\nin the year.\\n1. \\n Volumes for the UK are received complaints from eligible complainants to align with the current FCA \\nreporting. Volumes of complaints for the rest of the markets are based on resolved complaints. \\n13Our Commercial Banking customers\\n\\nOur Global Banking and \\nMarkets customers \\nHow we listen to our customers\\nWe provide nancial services and \\nproducts to governments, companies \\nand institutional clients around the world. \\nListening and reacting to customers \\n is one of the most important ways of \\nimproving our business.One of the \\nprimary ways we do this is through our \\nannual customer engagement survey. \\nCustomer satisfaction\\nIn this survey, 94% of our customers felt \\nour overall service and our commitment \\nto their business either improved or \\nstayed the same in 2018. Each aspect \\n of the survey is carefully reviewed to \\nconsider which actions can be taken \\n to improve customer perceptions of \\n us and the service we oer. \\nOne area where customers were \\ndissatised was our account opening \\nrequirements and how we update \\ncustomer information. Some customers \\nfelt that these were too cumbersome \\n and time-consuming. \\nAs a rst step, our credit and lending \\n team is rolling out a digital credit platform, \\na service that provides customers with \\nstandardised, automatically populated \\ncredit documentation that can be signed \\ndigitally. This service, now available in the \\nUK, has reduced the time it takes for our \\ncustomers to receive nancing. \\nWe are simplifying our know your \\ncustomer (KYC) questionnaire and \\nworked with compliance to streamline \\nthe KYC aspect of customer onboarding. \\nThis improved our risk management \\nprocess and reduced verication times \\nby 25%. We are also streamlining how \\nActing on feedback\\n      Customer survey results\\n63%of customers considered \\n HSBC as one of their \\n top three banks in 2018 \\n(2017: 64%)\\n46%of customers felt our people are \\nmore likely to initiate a strategic \\nconversation than 12 months ago \\n94%of customers felt our service \\nhad either stayed the same \\n or improved in 2018 \\n(2017: 96%)\\n95%of customers felt they had \\n a good or very good rapport \\nwith GB&M\\nResponding quickly and eciently to customers feedback \\nand complaints helps to build trust. We are placing a strong \\nemphasis on this, and reviewing the formal complaints \\nprocess in place for customers across all of the GB&M \\nbusiness lines to improve its eectiveness. \\nNew tools have been adopted to better record complaints and \\ntrack their resolution. In November 2018, we created a new \\nglobal team to look specically at customer experience. With \\na broad mandate, it focuses on careful analysis of feedback \\nand rapid resolution of complaints. \\nOne of its immediate tasks is to consolidate customer \\nfeedback and complaints across multiple business lines, \\ngeographies and products. This should help us improve the \\ncustomer experience, and identify any areas for collaboration \\nor early detection of potential issues.\\nCustomer experience meetings are now scheduled regularly \\nwith our top management. These bring together senior people \\nto look closely at customer concerns and produce consistent, \\nbusiness-wide solutions. \\nwe collect and store KYC information, \\ntechnology solutions and data access. \\nWe reduced onboarding times for our \\ncorporate customer base by 8% by the \\nend of 2018. There is still a lot to do and \\nour target is to reduce this by a further \\n20% by 2020. \\nFor more information on some of the \\nways we have made it easier and safer \\nfor customers to access our services \\ndigitally, see page 18.\\nCase study: Improving payments processing \\nIn 2018, we were approached by a potential customer \\n who was looking for a new banking provider to resolve \\nproblems they had faced regarding delayed payments. \\nSta salary payments had been repeatedly delayed, due \\n to a screening process that banks are required to carry \\n out to comply with regulations. This was an increasing \\nreputational risk for the rm. When we looked into the \\nproblem for them, it focused our attention on similar \\n issues faced by our existing customers. Not only did \\n we win this rm as a new customer, we also proposed \\n to take a proactive approach to screening payments \\n for existing clients, which noties customers of any \\n delays and obtains additional information needed to \\nidentify and release blocked payments within a target \\n of 48 hours. By making sure we collect information on \\nregular beneciaries upfront and use it eectively, we have \\nsignicantly reduced payment delays for our customers. \\n14Customers\\n\\nWhen things go wrong\\nOverall, the number of complaints \\nincreased in 2018, mainly in Global \\nLiquidity and Cash Management \\n(GLCM) due to a number of signicant \\nsystems upgrades and issues throughout \\nthe year. In most other GB&M \\nbusinesses, the number of complaints \\neither reduced or remained stable from \\n2017. In Global Markets, we had a \\nreduction in complaints resulting from \\nhuman error and processing issues in \\n our operations team. In Global Banking, \\nthe number of recorded complaints fell, \\nin part due to improvements to how \\n we record feedback. Previously, many \\ncomplaints that were related to the range \\nof products and services oered by \\nHSBC were recorded by Global Banking, \\nwhere the overall customer relationship \\nis managed. In 2018, we have aimed, \\nwhere possible, to record specic \\ncomplaints in relation toproducts and \\nservices against their specic product \\nline such as GLCM and Global Trade \\n and Receivables Finance products.\\nSpotlight: Conduct\\nImproving employee conduct remains one \\nof GB&Ms core priorities as we continue to \\npursue the highest standards across every \\naspect of our business. The way in which \\nwe conduct business helps us full \\n our purpose of connecting clients to \\nopportunities and helping economies to \\ngrow, while staying true to our values. \\nCustomers rely on us for our nancing, \\nadvisory and research expertise. They know \\nwe can access global debt, equity, currency \\nand commodity markets. It is vital that they \\ntrust us to manage their liquidity, keep their \\nassets safe, and nance their trade. \\nIn 2018, we took a fresh look at how \\n to help deliver fair outcomes for our \\ncustomers, and help ensure we do \\n not cause disruption to the orderly and \\ntransparent operation of nancial markets. \\nWe worked with third-party experts to \\nhighlight areas that needed improvement, \\nwhich led to a comprehensive new \\nprogramme to improve our conduct. The \\nkey areas of focus are highlighted below: \\nCulture and environment\\n We are expanding the dialogue \\n on conduct to help ensure we are \\nsupporting our people to make values-\\nbased judgements in situations they \\n face every day, and feel safe raising \\nconcerns. In the rst half of 2018, 5,200 \\nof our people attended 650 Exchange \\nmeetings to discuss our conduct and \\nculture, with further Exchange meetings \\nheld through the rest of 2018.\\n We have developed a network of conduct \\nchampions across the business to help \\ndrive conduct awareness and provide a \\ngroup of enthusiastic, committed people \\nto act as local sponsors for behavioural \\nchange. We have led region-specic \\nconduct weeks, where we highlighted \\nexamples of conduct in action across the \\nbusiness, and produced and updated \\ncountry-specic conduct handbooks. \\n We have a complex footprint across \\ndierent businesses, countries and desks. \\nThis can lead to a number of dierent \\ncultures  some of which will have issues \\nthat need to be addressed. In 2018, \\n we began a series of pilot exercises to \\nexamine the root causes of employee \\n and team behaviour, and to help design \\ninterventions. This will continue in 2019.\\n We introduced a new hiring guide \\n for managers to support the assessment \\n and selection of candidates, and \\nstrengthen our interview process \\n with a broader inclusion of values \\n and behavioural measures.\\n Our management and sta wanted more \\ntraining on conduct and how it applies \\n to them and their roles. We continue \\n to improve our conduct curriculum to \\nmeet this demand, including coverage \\n of behavioural drivers, conicts, grey \\nareas and specic technical training.\\nEmbedding conduct in core \\nbusiness processes\\n We have created a Global Markets \\nproduct risk function and appointed \\nco-Heads of Product Governance in \\nGlobal Markets to improve product \\ngovernance. Product due diligence \\ntemplates used across GB&M have been \\nenhanced in an eort to ensure conduct \\nis more carefully considered. Sales \\nsuitability procedures have been \\ndeveloped for people working in Global \\nBanking and the Institutional Client \\nGroup, and training has commenced \\n for Global Markets sales employees. \\n In our Exchange meetings on conduct \\n and culture in 2018, our people provided \\nfeedback that they wanted more support \\nunderstanding how pricing is determined \\nto support conversations with customers \\nand ensure consistency. New guidelines \\n on pricing and transparency have \\n since been agreed and published.\\nReinforcing our controls \\nframework \\n During 2018, our businesses ran \\nexercises to encourage a deeper \\nunderstanding of the conicts of interest \\nthat can occur in investment banking. \\nThese captured a more granular view of \\nthe potential situations that our people \\nneed to be aware of and actively manage. \\nOver 100 workshops have been held to \\ncreate an inventory of conicts of interest \\nthat could arise within GB&M, bringing \\nbusiness lines and regions together. \\n We reviewed all our Global Banking \\nlocations to assess whether they are \\nsegregated from other business lines \\n from the perspective of information \\ncontrol and managing conicts of interest.\\n We work in an environment where we are \\nentrusted with privileged information that \\nwe have a critical responsibility to protect. \\nIt is vital that high levels of information \\ncontrols are in place. Improvements in \\ncontrols and procedures have been \\nintroduced during 2018. Over 31,000 \\nHSBC employees across all GB&M oces \\ncompleted a bespoke training module on \\ninformation control procedures.\\n \\nFor further information on our approach to conduct \\nand the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.\\nGB&M annual complaint volumes\\n12018\\n2017\\nGlobal Markets\\n2201\\n273\\nGlobal Banking\\n330\\n417\\nSecurities Services\\n360\\n349\\nGlobal Liquidity and \\nCash Management\\n31,251\\n474\\nTotal\\n2,142\\n1,513\\n1. \\n A complaint is dened as any expression of dissatisfaction, whether upheld/justied or not, from \\n (or on behalf of) a former, existing or prospective customer relating to the provision of, or failure to \\n provide, a specic product or service activity.\\n2. Global Markets also includes research.\\n3. \\n GLCM excludes complaints relating to payment operations.\\n15Our Global Banking and Markets customers \\n\\nHow we listen to our customers\\nActing on feedback\\nGiven the direct access our customers have to their relationship managers, issues are usually resolved quickly. However, the \\ncustomer engagement survey highlighted how some customers do not feel their feedback is addressed properly. In response, \\nwe are improving how we record feedback to ensure this is addressed in a more systematic way. \\nWe have three global strategic investment programmes underway focused on improving customer engagement and supporting \\nsustainable business growth. These programmes, overseen by the GPB executive committee, are in the following table:\\nWe serve the needs of high net worth \\nand ultra high net worth individuals and \\nfamilies, helping them to grow, manage \\nand preserve their personal wealth from \\ngeneration to generation.\\nBuilding strong personal relationships \\nwith customers is critical in private \\nbanking. Our customer service teams, \\ncomprising relationship managers, \\ninvestment counsellors, product and \\ncredit specialists, and wealth planners \\ninteract with customers on a daily basis, \\nlistening to and acting on feedback.\\nCustomer satisfaction\\nIn addition to this feedback, we conduct \\nan annual customer engagement survey. \\nIn 2018, more than 800 customers \\nshared their views on our people, \\nproducts and services. Our overall \\nsatisfaction score fell from 8.4 to 7.6 \\n(based on a scale of 1 to 10), falling \\n short of our threshold target of 8.0. This \\ndecline corresponded with a decline in \\nour customers perception of whether \\n we oer value for money, falling from \\n91% to 76%.\\nHowever, our customers continue \\n to be satised with our relationship \\nmanagement teams, scoring them \\n 8.4 out of 10, while 86% strongly agree \\nthat our portfolio reviews meet their \\nnancial needs, by providing a score \\n of either 4 or 5 (on a scale of -5 to 5). \\nOur Global Private Banking \\ncustomers \\nThe three themes that have emerged \\nfrom this survey, which we need to \\naddress are: \\n We need to improve perceptions of \\n the quality of investment advice and \\nproducts, which is falling short of \\nexpectations. \\n We need to keep pace with increasing \\ncustomer expectations. We have been \\nslow to implement a global digital \\nproposition and our customers have \\nexperienced a higher number of \\ninstances than is acceptable where \\n the service they have received from \\n us left them feeling annoyed or \\n let down. \\n We need to change outdated \\nprocesses. Some of our customers \\n feel our processes and procedures are \\ncumbersome, and as a consequence \\nwe may not be easy to deal with.\\nArea of focus\\nAction\\nAdvisory services\\nWe are enhancing our advisory proposition through investment in technology that provides more sophisticated \\nportfolio construction and risk analytics capabilities. This should help us to improve our investment processes \\nand provide more proactive, well-informed advice. To support this, we increased the number of customer-\\nfacing investment professionals and product specialists by 17% in 2018, and plan to make further investments \\nin 2019, including a comprehensive training programme.\\nDigital\\nWe are aware that our investment in digital wealth management capabilities has lagged behind those of \\n our competitors. This has had an adverse impact on customer satisfaction. In 2018, we developed online \\n and app-based capabilities that went live initially in the UK in February 2019 and which will be introduced \\n to all our key markets during the year. A programme of continual enhancement will help ensure that these \\nservices remain competitive in the marketplace.\\nGlobal platform \\nreplacement\\nWe are rationalising the number of IT platforms, replacing legacy systems with a core platform that houses \\n a set of strategic solutions. This will facilitate global access to our agship products and propositions, bringing \\na consistent customer experience across our main booking centres.

Senior leaders \\n set the tone and recently supported a \\nseries of workshops for colleagues in \\n our European booking centres. These \\nincluded real conduct case studies for \\nsenior management and supervisors \\n to discuss with their teams, and will \\ncontinue in 2019 to maintain the \\n current level of focus.\\nStrengthening our controls \\nSince 2015, we have published \\n a number of conduct-related policies, \\nincluding those addressing conicts of \\ninterest, best execution, sales suitability, \\npricing, product governance, the \\nsupervisory framework and potentially \\nvulnerable customers.\\nWe continue to focus on ensuring these \\nare embedded and applied consistently \\nacross the business. Ongoing work to \\nstrengthen controls includes:\\n Sales suitability: We established sales \\nquality assurance (SQA) teams in \\n 2017, enabling us to focus on improving \\nthe quality and consistency of our \\ninvestment advice. In 2018, more than \\n3,200 trades were sample tested, 93% \\nof which provided advice in line with\\n our standards, with identied issues \\nresulting in appropriate remedial action \\nincluding customer contact where \\nnecessary. The SQA teams also perform \\nthematic reviews, focusing on high risk \\nscenarios. Where deviations from the \\nstandards or issues are identied, they \\nare escalated and corrective action is \\ntaken, where required. \\n Supervisory framework: We dened a \\nnew framework in 2018, establishing \\nclear standards and guidelines for \\nindividuals with responsibility for \\nsupervising customer-facing employees. \\n Product governance and pricing: We \\nstrengthened our product governance \\nin 2018 with increased global oversight. \\nOur product pricing principles, set by a \\nglobal pricing policy and fair value \\nexchange criteria for specic asset \\nclasses, are being embedded in all \\nbooking centres. \\nTraining our people \\n for fair outcomes\\nThrough the ongoing deployment of \\nrole-based learning, all customer-facing \\nteams completed conduct training as \\nrequired by their role in 2018. Building \\n on this, we developed specic learning \\nprogrammes for people managers \\n and supervisors. This training develops \\ncapabilities to supervise, coach and \\ndevelop relationship managers, \\ninvestment counsellors and customer \\nservice executives within GPB. \\n \\nFor further information on our approach to conduct \\nand the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.\\n17Our Global Private Banking customers\\n\\nWe are committed to improving customer \\nexperience through investments in \\ntechnology. Here we highlight some \\n of our areas of focus during 2018.\\nImproving customer experience\\nWe are investing in technology to get \\n to know our customers better and make \\nuse of these insights to provide them \\n with clarity about their nances. Digital \\nmessaging is used to help our UK \\ncustomers with nancial diculties \\nmanage their debt, including accessing \\ndebt consolidation services and charities \\nonline. Since launching this new service \\n in November 2018, we have received \\nmore than 17,000 visits. \\nFor our global and institutional customers, \\nwe became one of the rst banks in 2018 \\nto roll out Face ID login globally. The Live \\nChat service on HSBCnet is now available \\nto more than 56,000 customers in six \\ncountries. It has consistently high customer \\nsatisfaction ratings, reaching 89% in July \\n2018. We were also the rst foreign bank \\n in mainland China to allow customers to \\naccess services through WeChat.\\nMobile banking experience\\nWe have seen signicant growth in \\nmobile adoption rates for our retail \\ncustomers, with the proportion of mobile \\nactive customers increasing by almost \\n50% in 2018. We have introduced new \\nmobile app features, such as remote \\ncheque deposit in the UK and Canada, \\nmobile chat in the UK, and International \\nEducation Payment Solution (IEPS) in \\nChina, which allows customers to pay for \\ntheir childrens international education \\nfees from their mobile phones. \\nOur PayMe mobile app allows HSBC \\ncustomers and non-customers to send \\n and receive money instantly and for free. \\nPayMe has approximately 1.5 million \\nusers with over two million payments \\nmade each month, making it the number \\none peer-to-peer payments app in Hong \\nKong, according to the Hong Kong \\nMonetary Authority. \\nIn 2018, we launched new mobile apps in \\nve markets, with improved functionality \\nsuch as biometric login and the ability \\n to put temporary blocks on cards. As \\n we continue our roll-out of new apps, \\napproximately 20% of active mobile users \\nstill use the legacy app, which lacks some \\nfeatures users expect. This can be seen \\nthrough low Apple App store ratings, \\nwhere our legacy mobile app scores an \\naverage 1.9 out of 5 compared with the \\nnew app scoring 4.8 in the UK and \\n 4.7 in Hong Kong.\\nOur new Business Express mobile app \\nhelps enable our commercial customers \\n to stay on top of their business nances \\nany time, anywhere. Key features include \\nbiometric access through ngerprint \\n or facial recognition, fast and accurate \\ntracking of recent incoming funds, \\noutgoing payments as well as all trade \\ntransactions, plus instant help from the \\nchatbot Ask Amy 24/7. New features will \\nbe added, including notications and \\nfaster payment journeys. \\nMachine learning/AI\\nArticial intelligence(AI) and machine \\nlearningare becoming easier to use \\nthrough our adoption of cloud computing, \\nopen source frameworks and commercial \\nsolutions. AI is beingused to better \\nsegment customers for nancial crime \\ndetection and to investigate potential \\ncrime faster and to a higher quality.\\nMachine learningis at the heart of our \\nintelligence-led nancial crimemodels, \\nwhere it is being trialled to improve \\nreal-time detection rates and reduce \\n false positives. AI is also being used \\nincreasingly within our RBWM business \\n to determine customer needs, and to \\nenable us to make relevant oers to our \\ncustomers at the right time for them.\\nFor our retail customers, we introduced \\nmachine learning-enabled chatbots in \\nmainland China, Hong Kong and the \\n US to handle basic questions so that \\ncustomers would not need to wait for \\n a live agent to be available. \\nFor our global and institutional clients, \\n our virtual assistant uses machine learning \\nto answer customers questions.

In \\nresponse, we are investing in business \\nand technical controls to help prevent, \\ndetect and react to these cyber threats.  \\nWe are strengthening our controls to \\nhelp protect against advanced malware, \\ndata leakage, inltration of payment \\nsystems and denial of service attacks \\n as well as enhancing our ability to \\n detect and respond to cyber-attacks. \\n An important part of our defence \\nstrategy is ensuring our employees \\nremain cyber-aware and know how to \\nreport incidents.We continually evaluate \\nthe threat environment for the most \\nprevalent attack types and their potential \\noutcomes in order to determine the most \\neective controls. \\nWe operate a three lines of defence \\nmodel, aligned to the operational risk \\nmanagement framework, to identify, \\nreport and manage cyber risks within \\n the organisation. Global business and \\nfunction risk owners in the rst line are \\naccountable for identifying, owning and \\nmanaging the cyber risk. They work with \\ncontrol owners to help ensure controls \\nare in place to mitigate issues, prevent \\nrisk events occurring and resolve risk \\nevents if they do occur. These controls \\nare executed in line with policies \\nproduced by the second line information \\nsecurity risk teams and are overseen by \\nthe third line  the independent Internal \\nAudit function. \\nCyber risk and control eectiveness \\n was reviewed 11 times at non-executive \\nDirector level, including by the Board, \\nGroup Risk Committee and Group Audit \\nCommittee. It is also reported across the \\nglobal businesses, functions and regions \\nto help ensure appropriate visibility \\n and governance of the risk and its \\nmitigating controls.\\nWe participate in several industry bodies \\nand working groups to discuss cyber \\nrisks, including the following:\\n attendee of key banking association \\ncyber working groups in all regions, \\nincluding groups run by the Association \\nfor Financial Markets in Europe and the \\nHong Kong Association of Banks\\n contributor to the UKs National Cyber \\nSecurity Centre, specically through \\nthe Cyber Security Information Sharing \\nPartnership initiative\\n member of the following three chapters \\nof the Financial Services Information \\nSharing and Analysis Center: the \\n US, UK and Europe, and Asia-Pacic \\nchapters \\n member of the Institute of International \\nFinance cyber working group\\n contributor to the Cyber Security \\nIndustry Group, a nancial services \\nindustry-led information exchange \\nforum in the UK and\\n member of government-led computer \\nemergency response teams in major \\nmarkets, including the UK, US and \\nHong Kong.\\nOperational resilience\\nOperational resilience is the ability \\n to adapt operations to continue \\nfunctioning when  not if  circumstances \\nchange.We have a clear strategic \\napproach to operational resilience \\nconsidered from three perspectives, \\n while putting the impact on our \\ncustomers and colleagues at the centre \\n of our thinking: how we architect, design \\nand build systems and services how \\n we operate, run and monitor our control \\nenvironment and how we respond and \\nrecover in the event of disruption. \\nData privacy\\nWe are committed to protecting the \\nprivacy of data we hold and process, \\n in accordance with the laws and \\nregulations of the geographies we operate \\nin. We are focused on embedding a \\nculture designed to ensure data privacy \\n is at the heart of our organisation.\\nIn 2018, there were signicant changes \\n to EU data privacy laws, with the General \\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) \\ncoming into eect across the EU, while \\nnew data privacy legislation came into \\nforce in some non-EU jurisdictions. The \\nintroduction of the GDPR provided us with \\nan opportunity to review and reinforce our \\ndata privacy policies and controls across \\nthe Group, giving customers, employees \\nand stakeholders more transparency and \\ncontrol over how we use and manage \\ntheir information. A dedicated programme \\nof work was mobilised to execute and \\nembed GDPR requirements within HSBC \\nahead of its coming into force. We \\ncontinue to develop and focus our privacy \\ncapabilities in areas such as safeguards, \\nprivacy impact and risk assessments, sta \\ntraining, education and raising awareness. \\nData privacy is regularly reported at \\nmultiple Group-level governance forums, \\nwhich include Board level representation \\nto help ensure appropriate challenge \\n and visibility among senior stakeholders. \\nIn addition, data privacy governance \\nstructures have been established within \\nthe Group. We continue to work towards \\nembedding ownership and accountability \\nof data governance across all businesses \\nand functions in an eort to ensure \\neective management of risks.\\nIncreasing complexity in the matrix \\n of global data privacy laws, recent \\ndevelopments in data localisation \\nrequirements and the emergence of \\n new data-driven technologies continue \\n to challenge the banking industry. They \\nalso bring opportunities to serve our \\ncustomers better, and we recognise that \\ndata privacy and concepts such as privacy \\nby design are fundamental to achieving \\nthis. We continue to work closely with \\ndata privacy regulators, industry bodies \\nand external stakeholders around the \\nworld to stay abreast of regulatory \\ndevelopments in this area. \\nProtecting our customers data \\n19Customer developments across all global businesses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur relationship\\nOur people at HSBC span many \\ncultures, communities and continents. \\nWe want to build trusted relationships, \\nwhere our people feel empowered \\n in their roles and inspired to grow. \\n We help our leaders set the tone \\n by listening and valuing the \\n behaviours that get a job done \\n as much as the outcome. \\nWe understand the importance \\n of building a diverse and inclusive \\nworkforce, valuing individuals and \\n their contribution.

Results \\nare presented to the Group Management \\nBoard and relevant executive committees. \\nThis allows us to take action based on \\n the feedback. The adjacent table shows \\nselected results from our 2018 survey.\\nSnapshot survey\\nWe track employee advocacy by asking \\nwhether our people would recommend \\nHSBC as a great place to work. Currently, \\n66% of our people would recommend \\nHSBC, an increase from 64% in 2017. \\n We recognise there is more to do and \\n we are aiming to improve this measure \\n by three points each year through to \\n 2020. Analysis in 2018 showed us that \\ntrust in leadership, career development \\nand recognising our people for their \\nbehaviour and performance drive a \\npositive response to this question. \\nIn late 2018, we expanded our Snapshot \\nsurvey to look at behaviours by asking \\n if people see others demonstrating \\n our values. The feedback allows us to \\nidentify areas for improvement and \\n take meaningful action in 2019. \\nWe see that 74% of our people feel able \\n to speak up when they see behaviour that \\nthey consider to be wrong. It tells us that \\nour speak-up channels are working, but \\n we know there is further work to be done. \\nExchange \\nOur Exchange forums provide a place for \\nour people to share their open and honest \\nviews. Typically, these are meetings held \\nwithout an agenda, meaning people can \\ndiscuss what matters most to them. We \\nknow that when people participate in \\nExchange meetings, they feel more able \\nto speak up, have more trust in leadership \\nand report higher levels of well-being. \\nMore than half of our people took part \\n in an Exchange meeting during 2018. \\nOver 2,000 Exchange meetings were \\narranged to discuss our ambition to \\n create the healthiest human system in our \\nindustry. These involved 30,000 employees \\ntaking part and sharing what it means for \\nthem. It is clear from the feedback that we \\nneed to begin with frank, open and honest \\nconversations about what it feels like to \\nwork at HSBC.

Our global recognition programme At Our \\n Best allows people to recognise colleagues who live up to our values. Employees receive recognition points from their \\ncolleagues, which can be redeemed against a wide range of goods. In 2018, more than 720,000 recognitions were made \\n to a total value of $8.4 million. In 2018, we focused on HSBC sustainability, resulting in over 65,000 employee recognitions. \\nStories were shared as inspirational case studies on our intranet, HSBC NOW.

However, we \\nunderstand that in some circumstances \\npeople prefer a more discreet way to \\nraise their concerns. \\nWhistleblowing \\nHSBC Condential is a global platform \\nthat allows people to raise concerns \\noutside of our normal reporting and \\nescalation channels in condence \\n and without fear of retaliation. This \\n is available to all of our people, past \\n and present, in all global businesses, \\nfunctions and entities.\\nWithin this platform, we have \\n multiple channels to raise issues, \\n including telephone hotlines, online \\nportals and email. A broad range of \\n cases, covering a range of severity \\n levels, are dealt with each year. We also \\nmonitor an external email address for \\nconcerns about accounting, internal \\nnancial controls or auditing matters \\n (accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com). \\n In 2019, we plan to expand our use of \\n an independent third-party supplier to \\nmanage our 24/7 reporting hotline and \\nensure the service is available in the \\nGroups key local languages. \\nWe rely on our people to deliver fair \\noutcomes for our customers and make \\nsure we act with integrity in the nancial \\nmarkets. A high standard of personal \\nconduct is critical for our ability to live \\n up to this commitment and ensure \\n a healthy working environment for \\n our people. We actively manage \\nmisconduct by taking any necessary \\naction, up to and including dismissal. \\n We monitor and report cases on \\n a regular basis to management \\nAll whistleblowing concerns are subject \\nto an independent investigation, which \\n is carried out by teams trained to handle \\nsensitive cases. These include human \\nresources, compliance, legal, information \\nsecurity and internal audit. Cases are \\nallocated depending on the concerns \\nraised. In 2018, 74% related to people, \\n12% to security and fraud, 11% to \\ncompliance, and the remaining 3% to \\nother categories. Following investigation, \\nwe take appropriate action if necessary, \\nincluding disciplinary action or \\nadjustments to variable pay and/or \\nperformance and behaviour ratings.\\n We learn lessons and change our \\nprocesses where needed. \\nHSBC does not condone or tolerate \\nretaliation against people who raise \\nconcerns and we strictly enforce \\n our policy relating to this. Senior \\nmanagement are made aware of cases \\nalleging retaliation and the outcome or \\naction taken.

We seek \\nto reect the diversity of the markets we \\nserve, not only in our people but also \\n by encouraging diversity across our \\ncustomers, communities and suppliers.\\nWe believe in an enterprise-wide \\napproach to diversity and inclusion. \\n In 2018, we made good progress in \\nupdating our global procurement \\nprocesses to improve supplier diversity \\nand will continue this in 2019. We \\nconducted a refresh of our brand to \\ninclude inclusive imagery and principles \\nso our customers and people can see \\nthemselves in HSBC. We have introduced \\ntalking cash machines and sign language \\nservices on smartphones to provide \\nbarrier-free banking and insurance \\nproducts for same sex couples in Hong \\nKong. We know there is still more to do. \\nGender balance\\nGender balance in leadership is an area \\nwhere we are making progress but \\nrecognise the need to improve. We have \\nsigned up to the 30% Club campaign \\ncommitment to reach 30% women in \\nsenior leadership roles by the end of 2020. \\nIn 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership \\nwere women, above our goal of 27.6%. \\n In 2019, we are aiming for 29%. \\nTo help improve gender balance in \\n senior roles we provide mentoring and \\nsponsorship opportunities for talented \\nwomen. We extended our Accelerating \\nFemale Leaders programme in our \\n GB&M business to include our CMB and \\nGPB businesses. Through sponsorship, \\n the programme builds visibility and \\nconnectivity for Director-level female \\ntalent with leaders from across the Group. \\nIn 2018, 28.2% of our senior leadership \\n were women, above our goal of 27.6%.\\nOur employee networks\\nOur seven global employee networks and \\nour HSBC Communities discuss issues our \\npeople care about and challenge us on \\nwhere we could be doing better. We have \\nmore than 140 groups with over 80,000 \\nparticipants. The networks focus on \\ngender, age, ethnicity, LGBT+, faith, \\nworking parents and carers, and ability \\n(including mental health). Our HSBC \\nCommunities focus on a variety of \\ncommon interest topics including exible \\nworking, military and veterans, and \\nChinese culture. These groups play an \\nimportant role in helping us make progress. \\nOur largest global network, with over \\n48,000 participants, is Balance, which \\nworks to improve gender balance.\\nIn 2018, we introduced a global \\nmanagement structure for our LGBT+ \\nnetwork, Pride, to help network growth \\nand share best practice.\\nSpotlight: Gender pay gap \\nGender pay is an area of particular focus in the UK with the introduction of\\n the Gender Pay Gap (GPG) Reporting regulations. We have complied with \\n the regulations and reported our 2017/2018 GPG. Our UK gender pay gap is \\ndriven by the gender imbalance within our businesses and functions. There \\n are fewer women in senior leadership roles, meaning that we have more men \\nearning higher salaries.A higher proportion of women work in more junior \\n roles or work part-time hours. \\nWe are committed to improving gender balance and are taking a number \\n of specic steps that we expect to have a positive impact in the UK over \\n time, including:\\n driving better gender balance at all levels in the organisation\\n developing female talent to strengthen the leadership pipeline \\n supporting families and exibility and \\n retaining female talent.\\nWe are condent in our approach to pay and where we have identied pay \\ndierences that cannot be explained, we have made appropriate adjustments.\\n1. \\n Combined executive committee and direct reports \\nincludes HSBC executive directors, Group Managing \\nDirectors, and their direct reports (excluding \\nadministrative sta) plus Company Secretary.\\n2. \\n Senior leadership refers to employees performing \\nroles classied as 0, 1, 2 or 3 in our global career \\nband structure.\\n24Employees\\n\\nWell-being and developing \\nour people \\n Employee well-being\\nA healthy and happy workforce \\n is essential for a positive working \\nenvironment. Our priorities for our \\npeople are mental health, exible \\nworking and nancial well-being. \\nMental health\\nWe want HSBC to be an environment \\nwhere people feel they can be open about \\ntheir mental health and concerns. While \\nwe have taken action, we know there is \\nmore to do. \\nIn October 2018, we held over 75 events \\nto support World Mental Health Day. \\nThis included a video interview between \\nJohn Flint, our Group Chief Executive, \\nand Brian Heyworth, our Global Head of \\nClient Strategy, sharing their perspectives \\non mental health at HSBC. This has \\nbecome one of the most viewed internal \\nvideos and helped open the conversation \\nwithin HSBC.\\nWe oer an employee assistance \\nprogramme so our people have free \\naccess to external expert assistance and \\ncondential advice when they require it, \\nsuch as after suering a bereavement or \\npersonal diculty. We advertise these \\nthird-party programmes locally so our \\npeople have the available information \\n to get the best support. \\nWe use our learning platform, HSBC \\nUniversity, to publish articles and \\nresources relating to mental health \\n from industry-leading bodies. \\nIn 2019, we will start to provide \\nwidespread mental health education \\n and support to our people, starting with \\n a programme of mental health education \\nfor all managers. Our focus will be on \\nspotting the signs of mental ill-health, \\nhaving open conversations and \\nsignposting the right support. This will \\n be supported by local and Group-wide \\nawareness campaigns, recognising that \\nwe all have a part to play to create a \\n more open environment. \\nFlexible working\\nOur 2017 global well-being survey \\nconrmed that 49% of our people work \\nexibly, and those who do are more \\npositive about their general well-being. \\nWe know this is an area where people \\nwant more support, so during 2018 we \\ninvested in technology and infrastructure. \\nWe expanded an OpenWork concept, \\nwhich makes it easier for our people to \\nwork exibly across 27 cities covering \\napproximately 75,000 sta. This helped \\nmore of our people make positive choices \\nthat meet their needs both inside and \\noutside of work. \\nOne of our HSBC Communities, Flex, \\nwhich supports exible working, has \\n run global events on topics such as job \\nsharing. These included an event on \\nInternational Mens Day, which focused \\non male employees and the mental health \\nbenets of exible working. Our priority \\nfor 2019 is to implement consistent \\nexible working principles across HSBC.\\nFinancial well-being\\nIn 2018, we re-launched our employee \\nassistance programmes, to include \\nnancial support. In addition, multiple \\ncountries have run nancial capability \\nevents, including Mexico, UAE and the UK.\\nIn 2019, we are enhancing the content and \\nroll-out of our events and education as we \\nrecognise there is further action needed. \\n \\nFor more information on how we are working to \\nincrease nancial capability, see pages 11 and 34.\\n Learning and development\\nTalent development \\nWe recognise we must invest in our \\npeople to continue to thrive. \\nThe International Manager Programme is \\none of our agship talent programmes. \\nWith approximately 300 international \\nmanagers currently deployed across \\n 46 countries, the programme provides \\nresourcing exibility and helps us develop \\na strong pipeline of home-grown future \\nleaders for our most critical positions. \\nInternational mobility is key to future \\nsuccess.

Under \\nthe Paris Agreement, the country pledged to reduce \\nemissions by up to 41% by 2030 and recently adopted \\n the green sukuk framework to support its commitment. \\nTo fund climate mitigation and adaption projects in a \\nbroad range of sectors, as well as to demonstrate its \\ncommitment to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia issued \\nthe worlds rst green Islamic bond, known as a sukuk, \\nfor $1.25 billion in February 2018. HSBC acted as joint \\nlead manager, joint bookrunner and sole green \\nstructuring adviser. This transaction represented the \\n rst sovereign green sukuk, the rst international green \\noering by an Asian sovereign and the rst Asian \\nsovereign green bond focused on Paris Agreement \\nambitions. \\n28Supporting sustainable growth | \\nSustainable nance\\n\\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy \\nwill occur over a multi-year horizon and \\n it will take time for sectors currently \\ndependent on fossil fuels to adapt. While \\nit is acknowledged there should be a \\nsignicant and immediate reduction in \\nthe use of coal to generate power, other \\ntraditional sources of energy, such as oil \\nand gas, have a longer term role during \\nthe transition. Developing countries may \\nalso need more time to adjust as they \\nbalance sometimes competing \\nsustainable development goals.\\nIn this context, we are working to \\n further understand the specic risks \\n and opportunities climate change \\npresents to our customers, and we are \\ndeveloping our knowledge and capacity \\nto support their transition towards a \\n more sustainable future. We are doing \\n this through our engagement in the \\nEnergy Transitions Commission, \\n thought leadership articles published \\n on the Centre of Sustainable Finance \\n (www.sustainablenance.hsbc.com), \\n and other industry engagement.\\nIn 2018, we developed a transition \\n risk questionnaire with some of our \\ncustomers to improve our understanding \\nof their climate transition strategies. \\n This is helping us to identify which \\ncustomers need to adapt rapidly to \\nclimate-related risks, and spot potential \\nbusiness opportunities. In time, this \\ninformation can be incorporated into an \\ninitial assessment of transition risk within \\nour credit risk management processes. \\nWe plan to roll the questionnaire out \\nmore widely in 2019. We have also \\nembedded climate risk more broadly \\n in our risk management processes. \\n More information can be found in \\n the risk management section of \\n our TCFD disclosure on page 30.\\nAnother important element of our climate \\nrisk management is covered via our \\nsustainability risk management strategy. \\nSustainability risk is broader than climate \\nrisk. We dene it as the risk that nancial \\nservices provided to customers by the \\nGroup indirectly result in unacceptable \\nimpacts on people or the environment. \\nGroup Sustainability Risk, which is part of \\nthe Global Risk function, is responsible for \\nmanaging our sustainability risk policies \\n(covering agricultural commodities, \\nchemicals, defence, energy, forestry, \\nmining and metals, UNESCO World \\nHeritage sites, and Ramsar-designated \\nwetlands) and our application of the \\nEquator Principles. As with climate risk \\nmanagement, we seek to partner with \\n our customers to improve their operating \\nstandards. For more information on \\n how we manage sustainability risk, see \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nOur energy policy\\nOur approach is to support our \\ncustomers to transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy while limiting the nancing of \\nhigh-carbon intensity energy projects. In \\n2018, we updated our energy policy and \\nset out our position with respect to new \\nproject nancing of coal-red power, \\nOur approach to climate risk management \\n Engaging with our customers on palm oil\\nPalm oil is the worlds main vegetable oil. It requires less \\n land per output than other vegetable oils, and its production \\ncan bring wide economic benets. However, when produced \\nunsustainably, palm oil can lead to deforestation, resulting \\n in threats to endangered species, social conict and \\n climate change. \\nWe have worked closely with our customers to support \\ncertication through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm \\n Oil (RSPO), an independent organisation that sets standards \\nof good practice against which companies are independently \\ncertied. Internally, we have progressively raised our own \\npolicy standards. In 2014, we decided we would only nance \\ncustomers that were already partly certied under RSPO and \\naimed to complete certication by the end of 2018. Customers \\nalso need to provide evidence of independent verication \\nunder their commitments to No Deforestation, No Peat, and \\nNo Exploitation (NDPE). Our agricultural commodities policy \\nis available online at www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nA number of our customers have chosen to operate \\nsustainably as a result of our engagement, including \\n 11 customers that have introduced NDPE policies \\n following discussions with HSBC.At the end of 2018: \\n We nanced 22 customers engaged in palm oil \\n production that have either met our policy or will do so \\nshortly.Several customers are in the nal stages of full \\ncertication, managing external delays and resource \\nconstraints to meet our specic requirements.\\n We have 31 customers who have operations in the palm \\n oil sector, but where we do not nance this part of their \\nbusiness.We have engaged with those customers and \\nmany operate to or are working towards good practice. \\n We have 19 customers that do not meet our policy, \\n and we intend to discontinue the relationship when \\n existing loans have been repaid. \\ngreeneld projects in the oil sands, \\noshore Arctic drilling and due diligence \\nrequirements.\\nOur energy policy is available online at \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\\nHSBCs exposure to coal mining\\nIn 2016, we updated our mining and \\nmetals policy, so that we no longer \\nnance new thermal coal mines or new \\ncustomers dependent on thermal coal \\nmining. We also committed to publicly \\nreport on our exposure to the coal mining \\nsector. At 31 December 2018, our \\nexposure to coal mining was $0.8bn, \\nunchanged from a year earlier. This \\nrepresents 4% of our total exposure to \\nthe mining and metals sector in 2018. \\nWe have adopted a new methodology \\n for the identication of exposures to \\n the metals and mining sector in order \\n to align with our TCFD disclosure. The \\nmethodology is explained in footnote 37 \\non page 67 of the \\nAnnual Report and \\nAccounts 2018\\n.Equator Principles in 2018\\nUnder the terms of the Equator Principles, \\nwe report annually on the transactions \\ncompleted under the Principles. In 2018, \\nwe undertook 18 transactions under \\n the Principles, compared with 20 in 2017. \\nA detailed summary of our transactions \\n and implementation can be found at \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk/equator-\\nprinciples.\\n29Sustainable nance\\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\\nWe all have a role to play in limiting \\nclimate change and supporting the \\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, \\n and we are a signatory to the disclosure \\nrecommendations by the Financial \\nStability Boards task force. This \\nrepresents our second disclosure \\n under the framework. \\nGovernance\\nMitigating climate change is a key \\npriority for our senior leadership, with \\nsustainable nance metrics included in \\nthe Groups strategic priorities. In 2018, \\nthere were two presentations on \\nsustainability to the HSBC Holdings \\nBoard, two to the Group Audit \\nCommittee, four to the Group Risk \\nCommittee, and two to the HSBC Group \\nManagement Board. Senior leadership \\nhave engaged with regulators, industry \\nassociations and non-governmental \\norganisations on this topic, such \\n as through the Bank of England \\nconsultation on climate change, the \\nGroup Chairmans participation in the \\nOne Planet Summit and the Group \\n Chief Executives designation as a \\n World Economic Forum climate \\n leader. A summarised list of HSBCs \\nsustainability-related memberships is \\navailable at: www.hsbc.com/our-\\napproach/measuring-our-impact/\\nsustainability-memberships.\\nStrategy\\nSupporting the transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy is a key part of HSBCs \\nstrategy, and new products have been \\noered to facilitate this, along with a \\npledge to provide $100bn of sustainable \\nnance by 2025. To date, we have \\nreached $28.5bn of that goal. For further \\ninformation, see pages 26 and 28. We \\nrecognise many clients across sectors \\nare making signicant shifts towards the \\nlow-carbon economy. During 2019, we \\nintend to develop new metrics to help \\nmeasure these activities, with an aim to \\npublish in next years disclosure. \\nWe believe education of our people \\n is crucial on this topic. We gave \\nsustainability training to more than 2,300 \\nemployees during 2018 and launched a \\nsustainability online learning programme \\nfor all employees globally, with content \\ndeveloped in collaboration with the \\nUniversity of Cambridge Institute for \\nSustainability Leadership. \\nWe report on the emissions of our own \\noperations via CDP (formerly the Carbon \\nDisclosure Project). This is available, as \\nwell as other information related to the \\nsustainability of our own operations, \\n at: www.hsbc.com/our-approach/\\nmeasuring-our-impact.\\nRisk management\\nWe are increasingly incorporating \\nclimate-related risk, both physical and \\ntransition, into how we manage and \\noversee risks internally and with our \\ncustomers. Climate risk is now included \\nas a theme in our Top and emerging \\nrisks report to ensure that it receives \\nmonthly management oversight via the \\nRisk Management Meeting of the Group \\nManagement Board (RMM) (see page \\n30 of our \\nAnnual Report and Accounts \\n2018\\n). In addition, our Board-approved \\nrisk appetite statement contains a \\nqualitative statement on our approach \\n to sustainability, which will be further \\nexpanded in 2019 to include climate \\n risk explicitly. \\nWe have a number of sustainability risk \\npolicies covering specic sectors. In 2018, \\nwe updated our energy policy to limit the \\nnancing of high-carbon-intensity energy \\nprojects, while still supporting energy \\ncustomers on their transition to a low-\\ncarbon economy. From the release of the \\nnew energy policy in April 2018 until the \\nend of 2018, HSBC nanced no new \\ncoal-red power plants. \\nTransition risk, in the context of climate \\nchange, is the possibility that a customers \\nability to meet its nancial obligations will \\ndeteriorate due to the global movement \\nfrom a high-carbon to a low-carbon \\neconomy. HSBC is working to embed \\ntransition risk into its day-to-day credit risk \\nmanagement. The aim is that over time, \\neach wholesale counterparty will receive \\na client transition risk rating based on their \\nsusceptibility to, and ability to manage, \\ntransition risk. \\nWe have identied six higher transition \\nrisk sectors based on their contribution to \\nglobal carbon dioxide emissions. These \\nsectors are: oil and gas building and \\nconstruction chemicals automotive \\npower and utilities and metals and \\nmining. Over time we may identify \\nadditional sectors as having higher \\ntransition risk depending on a variety \\n of factors, including country-level \\n carbon dioxide reduction plans per \\n the Paris Agreement.\\nThe table below presents our exposure \\n to the six higher transition risk sectors. \\nThese gures capture all lending activity, \\nincluding environmentally responsible \\ncustomers and sustainable nancing. \\nFurther details on our approach to the \\nquantication of exposures can be found \\nin footnote 37 on page 67 of the \\nAnnual \\nReport and Accounts 2018\\n. This is \\nexpected to evolve over time as we \\ndevelop new climate-related metrics.\\nNext steps\\nHSBCs TCFD disclosures will continue \\nto evolve and expand over time. In line \\nwith TCFD recommendations, our \\nAnnual Report and Accounts \\nwill start \\n to disclose the additional climate \\nrisk-related metrics relating to our \\nportfolio for specic sectors, as the \\navailability of sucient, reliable and \\nrelevant customer data permits.\\nSector\\n% of total wholesale loans and advances to \\ncustomers and banks in 2018\\n37Oil and gas\\n 3.9%\\nBuilding and construction\\n 3.8%\\nChemicals\\n 3.9%\\nAutomotive\\n 3.4%\\nPower and utilities\\n 3.0%\\nMetals and mining\\n 2.8%\\nTotal\\n 20.8%\\nTotal wholesale loans and advances to customers and banks amount to $668bn.\\n  For footnote 37, see page 67 of the \\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2018.\\n30Supporting sustainable growth | \\nSustainable nance\\n\\nOur approach with our suppliers\\nWe have globally consistent standards \\nand procedures for the onboarding and \\nuse of external suppliers. We require \\nsuppliers to meet our compliance and \\nnancial stability requirements, as well \\n as to keep to our sustainability code \\n of conduct. Payment on time is of \\nparamount importance, and as such our \\ncommitment to paying our suppliers is in \\nline with the UK Prompt Payment Code.\\nSupplier ethical code \\n of conduct\\nWe have an ethical and environmental \\ncode of conduct for suppliers of goods \\nand services, which must be complied \\nwith by all suppliers. While our businesses \\nand functions are accountable for \\n the suppliers they use, our global \\nprocurement function owns the code \\n of conduct review process for them. \\nOur goal is to work collaboratively \\n with our supply chain partners on \\nsustainability at all times. When a \\nsupplier or one of its sub-contractors \\n is found to no longer be in compliance \\nwith this code, we will work with them \\non an improvement plan or, if deemed \\nnecessary, terminate the relationship. \\nThe ethical code of conduct, which we \\nrequire suppliers to adopt, sets out the \\nstandards for economic, environmental \\nand social impacts and outlines the \\nrequirements of having a governance \\nand management structure to ensure \\ncompliance with this code.\\nSuppliers \\n Our supplier management conduct \\nprinciples also set out how we conduct \\nbusiness with our third-party suppliers \\nboth in our legal and commercial \\nobligations. They also explain how \\n we treat suppliers fairly through our \\nbehaviour and actions, in line with \\n the HSBC Values.\\nSupplier diversity initiative\\nWe have a connected global supply \\nbase and inclusive sourcing strategies \\nthat reect the communities where we \\noperate, and help ensure we meet the \\nneeds of our diverse customer base. In \\nJune 2018, we also developed a supplier \\ndiversity and inclusion action plan, \\nwhich encourages the use of minority-\\nowned and SME businesses.\\n31\\nIn 2012, we set ourselves 10 strategic \\ntargets to reduce the environmental \\n and ethical impacts of our operations by \\n2020. Most of these are either completed, \\nresulting in us having stretched some of \\nthese targets, or are on track to complete. \\nWe are experiencing challenges on our \\nrecycling goal and some of our stretched \\ntargets, as detailed below. \\nThe targets include strategic goals to \\nreduce our carbon emissions, energy, \\nwaste, water and paper. We also set \\ntargets to increase recycling, procure \\nelectricity from renewable sources and \\ncommission buildings to the highest \\nsustainability standards. In addition, \\n we are working to enable sustainability \\neducation for our people, engage with \\n our supply chains and fund pilot projects. \\nAchieving our operational goals\\nSustainable operations \\n We reached three of our targets ahead \\n of schedule, and in 2017 made our \\n waste and paper reduction targets more \\nambitious, and committed to procuring \\nelectricity from 100% renewable sources \\nby 2030. \\nTo see progress against all our goals, visit \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/building-a-\\nsustainable-future/sustainable-operations. \\nThe strategic goals are governed by \\n the Group Chief Operating Ocer \\nSustainability Committee, which meets \\nquarterly. Each of the goals is owned by \\nan executive sponsor who is responsible \\nfor the target being achieved. In seeking \\nto reach our goals, we collaborate closely \\nwith our strategic suppliers and our \\nemployees to encourage positive actions. \\nReducing carbon emissions\\nWe continue to reduce our carbon emissions by cutting our \\nenergy consumption, being more ecient in our buildings, \\nworking with our strategic partners and focusing on our \\nrenewable procurement strategy. Since 2011, our carbon \\nemissions have fallen by 30% per FTE. In 2018, our total CO\\n2 emissions were 559,000 tonnes.\\n11. \\n PwC performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with \\nInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance \\nengagements on greenhouse gas statements, issued by the International \\nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board. This can be found on our website \\nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/measuring-our-impact. \\nOur people want to make a dierence in \\ntheir communities and at work, and we \\nwill continue topartner with them to \\n focus on our waste and recycling goals. \\nWe are proud to have surpassed our \\ngreen buildings goal of constructing \\n 50 buildings to the highest sustainability \\nstandards. In 2018, we opened our \\n new HSBC UK headquarters, which \\n was built to a Leadership in Energy \\n and Environmental Design (LEED) \\n Gold standard, making it the rst \\n building in Birmingham to be constructed \\nto this standard. The LEED certication \\n is a globally recognised symbol of \\nsustainability achievement. In 2019, we \\nare opening our new UAE headquarters \\nwith a LEED Gold standard and will intend \\nto continue to incorporate sustainability \\nstandards in new buildings. \\n32Supporting sustainable growth\\n\\nOur renewable electricity challenge\\nSince 2012, our renewable electricity strategy has evolved \\n from purchasing renewable energy credits to inuencing the \\nmarkets in which we operate by sourcing electricity through \\npower purchase agreements (PPAs) that provide additional \\nrenewable energy to a countrys energy mix. In 2017, we \\ncommitted to ensuring that 100% of our electricity was sourced \\nfrom renewable sources by 2030, with an interim commitment \\n of 90% by 2025.Between 2012 and the end of 2018, we \\ncontracted up to 29% of our electricity consumption through \\nPPAs in various countries. As we strive to achieve our goal, \\n we are conscious of the challenges this will present, such as \\n in some markets in Asia where PPAs are currently unavailable. \\nWe are members of global initiatives, such as RE100, a \\n global initiative uniting more than 100 inuential businesses \\ncommitted to 100% renewable electricity, that aim to create \\n a united corporate voice to inuence countries policy to open \\nmarkets.However, in some smaller Asian markets, our electricity \\nconsumption is too small for projects to be economically viable, \\nand therefore we will look to partner with other companies for \\n a collaborative solution. By nding solutions to problems our \\ncustomers and other companies face, we are in turn solving \\n our own similar challenges, and \\nvice versa\\n. Our waste challenge\\nOur 2020 target was to reduce our total waste by 50% from our \\n2011 baseline. This was achieved in 2015, and then stretched \\n to reduce by 75% from this 2011 baseline. At 2018, we had \\nreduced total waste by 63%.\\nOur recycling target is for 100% of our oce and electronic \\nwaste to be recycled by 2020. Since 2011, we have recycled \\n61% of our oce waste. \\nWe are progressing well on our waste reduction target, however \\nour recycling goal will be a challenge to achieve. As we continue \\nto reduce our total waste, it becomes increasingly challenging to \\nincrease or maintain recycling levels. \\nWith dierences within cities and buildings, we continue to \\naddress the waste challenge by nding ways to reduce waste, \\nsegregate and recycle. Most importantly, we continue to \\nengage with our employees to better explain and further \\neducate on local waste and recycling challenges.\\n29%signed renewable electricity from power purchase \\n agreements (2017: 27%)\\nAchieving our operational goals \\ncontinued\\n33Sustainable operations\\n\\nWe have a responsibility to invest in \\n the long-term prosperity of our global \\ncommunities.

We aim to \\nact with courageous integrity in all we do. \\nThis guiding principle means having the \\ncourage to make decisions based on doing \\nthe right thing for customers and never \\ncompromising our ethical standards \\n or integrity.\\nWe have also sought to learn from past \\nmistakes, such as the following three \\nexamples, and we are seeking to develop \\nand implement specic measures \\ndesigned to prevent recurrence of similar \\nevents in the future.\\nAnti-money laundering \\n and sanctions\\nBetween the 1990s and 2010, as \\nacknowledged by HSBC in various \\nagreements with US and UK authorities \\n in 2012, HSBC failed to implement \\nappropriate anti-money laundering (AML) \\nand sanctions controls. These oversight \\nand control failures resulted in HSBC \\nallowing at least $881 million in drug \\nproceeds to be laundered through \\n HSBC into the US nancial system and \\napproximately $660 million in transactions \\ninvolving sanctioned countries, such \\n as Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma, \\n to be processed, in violation of applicable \\nUS laws.\\nIn December 2012, HSBC entered into \\nresolutions with, among others, the US \\nDepartment of Justice (DoJ) and the UK \\nFinancial Services Authority (now the \\nFinancial Conduct Authority, or FCA), \\nregarding these past AML and sanctions-\\nrelated failings. Under these agreements, \\nwhich included a ve-year deferred \\nprosecution agreement with the DoJ \\n (the AML DPA), HSBC made payments \\ntotalling $1.9bn to US authorities and \\nundertook various further obligations, \\nincluding the retention of an independent \\ncompliance monitor. \\nRestoring trust \\n Over the past several years, we \\n have radically restructured our global \\noperations and signicantly strengthened \\nour ability to combat nancial crime. \\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility \\nto help protect the integrity of the global \\nnancial system. In order to full that \\nresponsibility, we have made, and continue \\nto make, signicant investments in our \\nability to detect, deter and prevent nancial \\ncrime. We have exited customers, \\nproducts and countries where we deemed \\nthe nancial crime risk too high to manage. \\nWe are also working with governments \\nand other banks to advance our mutual \\ninterests in this area. These steps are \\nenabling us to much more eectively \\nreduce the risk of nancial crime.\\nIn 2012, we launched our Global \\nStandards initiative, focused on putting \\n in place the most eective standards to \\ncombat nancial crime across our \\noperations globally. As part of this \\n eort, we designed and implemented \\nnew, globally consistent policies on \\n AML and sanctions that often extend \\nbeyond the requirements of local laws \\nand regulations. Since 2013, we also \\nestablished a Financial System \\nVulnerabilities Committee (FSVC) \\n to oversee our nancial crime risk \\nmanagement reforms. The FSVC reports \\n to the Board on matters relating to \\nnancial crime and nancial system \\nabuse, and provides a forward-looking \\nperspective on nancial crime risk, \\nanti-bribery and corruption.\\nAmong other steps, we hired experienced \\nsenior personnel to lead the eort and \\nsignicantly increased our nancial crime \\ncompliance capabilities we put in place \\n a robust investigations capability we \\nimproved and expanded our nancial \\ncrime compliance training initiatives \\n and we upgraded or replaced key \\ncompliance IT systems, with over \\n $1bn spent since 2015.\\nBeyond these improvements, as part of \\nour commitment to protect the integrity \\n of the nancial system, and to do our part \\nto ght nancial crime, we continue to \\nenhance our systems and are working to \\nintegrate our reforms into our day-to-day \\nrisk management practices so that our \\nprogramme is eective and sustainable \\nover the long term. We are also renewing \\nour focus on anti-bribery and corruption \\nas part of a dedicated three-year \\nprogramme to advance the Groups \\nanti-bribery and corruption risk \\nmanagement capability. As part of our \\ncommitment to the UN Global Compact, \\nwe have pledged to work against \\ncorruption in all its forms, including \\nextortion and bribery.\\nThe AML DPA expired in December 2017, \\nand we are pleased that our progress in \\nstrengthening our AML and sanctions \\ncompliance capabilities has been \\nrecognised. Our work in this area will \\ncontinue to be consistent with our \\nstrategic priority of safeguarding our \\ncustomers and delivering industry-leading \\nnancial crime standards.\\nOver the coming years, we aim to evolve \\nsignicantly our approach to nancial \\ncrime risk management by building \\nadvanced analytical capabilities, \\nincluding articial intelligence, designed \\nto help us target illicit conduct with \\ngreater sophistication and precision. \\n This will help us make a step change \\n in our eectiveness at ghting nancial \\ncrime and set a new standard that aims \\nto lead the industry. We expect to be \\nfaster and more accurate at detecting \\npotential nancial crime and ever more \\ntargeted in our risk assessments. We \\nexpect to generate actionable insight that \\nwe can use ourselves and provide to law \\nenforcement to help keep criminals out \\nof the nancial system. This will benet \\nthe Group, our customers and society \\n at large.\\n \\nFor further information about our compliance \\ninitiatives, see page 41.\\n37\\nCustomer tax evasion \\nPrior to 2011, our Swiss private bank \\nprovided its customers with standard \\nservices, common in the Swiss banking \\nindustry at the time, which enabled \\ncustomers to conceal their assets from \\ntax authorities and avoid paying their \\ntaxes. These services included, among \\nother things, the opening of encoded \\nnumbered accounts that kept the \\naccount holders name condential \\n and the provision of hold mail services \\nwhereby all mail was kept at the bank \\n for customers to avoid receiving letters \\n at their domestic addresses. Our Swiss \\nprivate bank, through certain of its \\nrelationship managers, oered these \\nservices while it had access to \\ninformation enabling it to know, or \\n to suspect, that certain customers would \\nuse those services in order to conceal \\ntheir assets from tax authorities.\\nWhile HSBC has reached agreements \\nwith certain law enforcement authorities \\nto resolve investigations relating to \\nallegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, \\nmoney laundering and unlawful cross-\\nborder banking solicitation arising \\n out of these past practices, the Group \\ncontinues to cooperate in ongoing \\ninvestigations by other tax \\nadministration, regulatory and law \\nenforcement authorities around the \\nworld in connection with similar \\nallegations. We acknowledge that the \\ncompliance culture and standards of due \\ndiligence in our Swiss private bank were \\nsignicantly lower in 2006 and 2007 than \\nthey are today. With hindsight, it is clear \\nthat we maintained too many small and \\nhigh-risk customer accounts and our \\nprivate banking business was stretched \\nover too many geographical markets, \\n all of which contributed to failings in \\nstandards, culture and controls. \\nIn recent years, our Global Private \\nBanking (GPB) business has taken \\nsignicant steps to address these \\nhistorical control weaknesses, most \\nnotably in Switzerland. Beginning in \\n2012, GPB developed a tax transparency \\npolicy that included enhanced know your \\ncustomer (KYC) and AML procedures \\nand a review of existing accounts against \\npotential indicators of non-compliance \\nwith tax obligations.

GPB has \\n also amended its standard terms and \\nconditions, which now require customers \\nto arm that they are in compliance with \\ntheir tax obligations, allow the bank to \\nrefuse requests for cash withdrawals and \\nplace strict controls on withdrawals over \\n$10,000. Furthermore, GPB discontinued \\nits hold mail service and has withdrawn \\nfrom markets where it has been unable \\nto conduct due diligence to a satisfactory \\nstandard on its customers.\\nAs a result of these reforms, the number \\nof accounts and total customer assets \\n of GPB have been signicantly reduced \\nby this intensive de-risking exercise, \\nwhere we have put compliance and \\n tax transparency ahead of protability. \\nWhere we used to oer banking services \\nto customers in more than 140 countries, \\nGPB now focuses on 34 strategic \\nmarkets, with customer assets actively \\nmanaged down by $140bn between \\n2013 and 2018.\\nWhile GPB has resolved a number \\n of legacy issues relating to the \\n past, investigations into former \\n practices are ongoing in a number \\n of countries at the time of publication. \\n In addition, we acknowledge that \\n GPBs role in providing nancial \\n services to high-prole individuals may \\nsometimes result in GPB receiving \\n undue media attention.\\n \\nFor further information about our Global Private \\nBanking customers, see pages 16 and 17.\\nForeign exchange conduct\\nPrior to 2013, our foreign exchange (FX) \\nbusiness lacked adequate governance, \\noversight and risk management in order \\nto ensure compliance with safe and \\nsound banking practices and applicable \\ninternal policies. As a result, we failed to \\ndetect and address unsafe and unsound \\nconduct by certain of our FX traders, \\nwhich included the misuse of condential \\ninside information to conduct FX trades, \\npossible agreements with traders of \\nother institutions to coordinate FX trading \\nand disclosure of condential information \\nto traders of other institutions. \\nIn November 2014, HSBC agreed to \\nregulatory settlements with the FCA \\n and the US Commodity Futures Trading \\nCommission in connection with their \\nrespective investigations of HSBCs \\ntrading and other conduct involving FX \\nbenchmark rates. In September 2017, \\nHSBC entered into a consent order with \\nthe US Federal Reserve Board (FRB) \\n in connection with its investigation into \\nHSBCs FX activities. Under the terms \\n of that order, HSBC agreed to undertake \\ncertain remedial steps and to pay a civil \\nmoney penalty to the FRB. In January \\n2018, HSBC Holdings plc entered into \\n a three-year deferred prosecution \\nagreement with the DoJ (FX DPA), \\nregarding fraudulent conduct in \\nconnection with two particular \\ntransactions in 2010 and 2011. \\nSince the historical conduct described \\n in these agreements, we have introduced \\na number of measures designed to make \\nthe control environment more robust \\n and prevent these failings from recurring \\nin the future. We have dedicated, \\n and continue to dedicate, signicant \\nresources to strengthen our systems \\n and controls. While the investigations \\nfocused specically on our FX activity, \\nthey have also given us good reason \\n to look again at other aspects of our \\nconduct more broadly within the Global \\nBanking and Markets (GB&M) business. \\nImprovements to our conduct agenda \\nstarted more than four years ago and \\ncontinue to this day. We are enhancing \\nand accelerating progress made in \\nstrengthening and remediating our \\nsystems and controls and broader \\ncompliance culture through a newly \\nestablished GB&M Conduct Committee, \\nled by our GB&M Chief Executive Ocer. \\nMarket experts are providing input. \\n The agenda focuses on culture and \\nbehaviours customers, including \\nsuitability, conicts of interest, pricing \\nand transparency markets, covering \\nmarket conduct, trade execution and \\ncompetition governance and controls \\nand strategy and business planning. \\nProgress is being tracked and reported \\nthrough our own governance channels, \\nas well as being reported to the FRB, \\n DoJ and our regulators in line with our \\nagreements with them all.\\nConduct is core to how we operate \\n and manage our business. We have \\nalready implemented improvements \\n to algorithmic trading to manage risk \\naround benchmark orders, and updated \\nour policies for sales, order handling, \\nmanaging condential customer \\ninformation and conicts of interest, \\npre-hedging and market abuse. In 2018, \\nwe introduced further improvements to \\nthe management of sensitive information \\nthrough physical barriers, technology \\ncontrols and procedures. We have also \\ncontinued to invest in enhancing our \\nvoice, trade and electronic surveillance \\ncapabilities across the globe to improve \\nthe monitoring of telephone calls, instant \\nmessages and trades to spot potentially \\nimproper activity. Global and regional \\nconduct governance forums have been \\ncreated to provide supervision and \\noversight over the implementation and \\neectiveness of our conduct agenda. An \\nextensive plan is in place, and we aim to \\ndeliver this as fast and eciently as we \\ncan.

It also approves capital and \\noperating plans for achieving strategic \\nobjectives on the recommendation \\n of management. \\nThe majority of the Board comprises \\nindependent non-executive Directors. \\nTheir role is to challenge and scrutinise \\nthe performance of management and \\n to help develop proposals on strategy. \\nThey also review the performance of \\nmanagement in meeting agreed goals \\nand objectives and monitor the Groups \\nrisk prole. During 2018, the Board \\nreduced the number of Board committees \\nfrom seven to ve. These changes created \\nclearer and stronger lines of authority and \\naccountability, which enable the Board to \\ndevote more time to priority areas.\\nBoard diversity \\nIn 2018, the Boards diversity and inclusion \\npolicy was updated to help ensure HSBC \\nand its various stakeholders continue \\n to benet from a Board that includes \\nDirectors from a range of dierent \\nbackgrounds and whose ethnicity, \\nexperience, age, geographical provenance \\nand gender more closely reect the \\ndiversity of our customers and the \\ncommunities that we serve.

The new Code places \\ngreater emphasis on how the Board \\nconsiders the interests of all stakeholders \\nin its discussions and decision making, \\nand promotes a strong internal culture. \\nWe see the new Code as an opportunity \\nto further enhance our existing \\nstakeholder engagement, ensuring that \\nthe business as a whole can continue \\n to develop constructive and considerate \\nrelationships. We aim to include details \\n of this in the \\nAnnual Report and \\nAccounts 2019. \\n Sustainability governance \\nWhile the Board has oversight of the \\nGroups sustainability and ESG initiatives, \\nthe Group Management Board is \\naccountable for their delivery, reected in \\nsustainability targets within the long-term \\nincentive scorecards for executive \\nDirectors, and selected scorecards of \\nGroup Managing Directors. The 2017 \\nlong-term incentive scorecards of \\nexecutive Directors incentivise achieving \\n a cumulative nancing and investment \\ntarget of $30bn to $34bn for developing \\nclean energy and lower-carbon \\ntechnologies and projects that contribute \\nto the delivery of the Paris Agreement and \\nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals \\nover the three-year period to 31 December \\n2020. The 2018 long-term incentive \\nscorecards of executive Directors include \\nan ESG rank measure incentivising \\nachievement of Outperformer \\nSustainalytics rating.\\nAs discussed in our TCFD disclosure on \\npage 30, the Board receives a half-yearly \\nsustainability update, covering topics such \\nas progress against the three sustainability \\npillars and non-governmental organisation \\n(NGO) engagement. This helps ensure \\nour sustainability agenda remains \\nprominent at the most senior levels. \\nOur Climate Business Council coordinates \\nsustainable nance activities across the \\nGroup, supported by various working \\ngroups within global businesses, \\nfunctions and regions. An ESG Steering \\nCommittee, chaired by the Group Chief of \\nSta, leads our approach on ESG topics, \\nincluding considerations related to \\nexternal disclosure and materiality. \\nA climate risk working group was \\nestablished in 2018, which seeks to \\nimplement the objectives of the Climate \\nBusiness Council through the development \\nof policy and limit frameworks designed to \\nprotect the Group from climate-related \\nrisks (including transition risk and physical \\nrisks) that are outside risk appetite. The \\nGroup Risk Committee is responsible for \\noverseeing enterprise risks that have an \\nimpact on the Group, including climate risk.\\nSee page 30 for our TCFD disclosure.\\n40A responsible business culture \\n\\nSafeguarding the \\n nancial system \\n We continued to consolidate our \\nprogress in tackling nancial crime \\n while launching initiatives in a number \\n of new areas.\\nOur Global Standards programme, \\nlaunched in 2013 to upgrade our nancial \\ncrime controls, is now approaching its \\nconclusion. During 2018, we concentrated \\non completing some of the nal elements \\nof the programme designed to ensure \\nmanagement of nancial crime risk is well \\nembedded in our day-to-day activities, \\nwith robust governance and reporting to \\nenable performance to be assessed. \\nIn June, we set out new strategic priorities \\nincluding the aim of delivering industry-\\nleading nancial crime standards. \\nDeveloping an intelligence-led approach \\n to nancial crime risk management using \\nnew technologies and advanced analytical \\ntechniques is key to achieving this \\nambitious target. We made good progress \\non this agenda and will continue to develop \\nour approach in 2019 and beyond.\\nWe launched an anti-bribery and \\ncorruption transformation programme, to \\nenhance the policies and controls around \\nidentifying and managing these risks \\nacross the Group. We also launched a \\ntransformation programme to strengthen \\nour ability to ght fraud and protect \\n our customers. \\n \\nFor more information on our Global Standards \\nand anti-bribery and corruption programmes, \\nsee pages 37 to 39.\\nTechnology \\nTechnologies such as articial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics will \\nenable us to tackle nancial crime more eectively. Our approach combines \\ndeveloping our own technology solutions with bringing in the best external \\ntechnology. \\nOur investment in a start-up company called Quantexa enabled our investigators \\nin 2018 to deploy a new software system to spot nancial crime networks in near \\nreal time by looking at internal and external data to nd possible links between \\nindividuals or companies. Working with another ntech company, Caspian, \\n we have developed a system that assembles all the relevant information on a \\nparticular suspicious transaction. It then uses AI to recommend whether it should \\nbe investigated further, enabling our people to focus on the highest priority cases. \\nOur agship intelligence-led initiative is a new approach that combines a \\n range of data sources to dynamically assess the potential nancial crime risk \\nthat an individual customer presents. We believe it will enable us to be faster \\nand more accurate at detecting suspicious activity and more granular in our \\n risk assessments. During 2018, we developed a prototype that, while at an \\n early stage, has proved to be markedly better at nding potential nancial \\n crime than existing industry-standard methods. We will begin to implement \\n it in 2019, alongside existing systems. We continue to engage with regulators \\non our approach.\\nPartnerships\\nThe insights delivered by new technology will have the greatest impact when \\nwe work with partners. Public-private partnerships enable banks to share \\ninformation with each other, regulators and law enforcement. We are a \\nmember of all six public-private nancial crime partnerships that have been \\nestablished around the world. Through our membership we can provide \\nbetter insight about suspicious transactions to law enforcement and receive \\nintelligence that helps us to better target our work in detecting nancial crime.\\nWe continue to advocate for partnerships in other jurisdictions and for \\n the eective operation of existing partnerships, including sponsoring public \\nresearch into the future of nancial intelligence sharing due to be released \\n in 2019.\\nSociety \\nDuring 2018, we successfully trialled an approach to providing victims of \\nhuman tracking in the UK with monitored retail banking facilities, working \\nclosely with charities that provide support to victims. The aim is to help the \\nvictims reintegrate with society and break the cycle of abuse. The accounts \\nwere trialled through a small number of branches and we will now make them \\navailable in other areas of the UK. \\nFinancial crime can have a devastating impact on the societies that we serve, \\nand we have taken active steps to reduce that impact. In October, we joined \\nthe task force established by United for Wildlife to coordinate nancial rms \\ntackling the illegal wildlife trade by helping prevent the ow of illicit prots. \\nMembers of the task force signed up to a declaration that commits them to \\nsteps such as providing intelligence about the trade to regulatory bodies and \\nlaw enforcement agencies. \\nThe scale of our work \\nEach month, we screen over 658 \\nmillion transactions across 207 \\nmillion accounts for signs of money \\nlaundering and nancial crime. In \\naddition, we screen approximately \\n130 million customers and 37.3 \\nmillion transactions monthly for \\nsanctions exposures.During 2018, \\nwe led over 85,000 suspicious \\nactivity reports to law enforcement \\nand regulatory authorities where we \\nidentied potential nancial crime.\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\nKeeping a responsible \\n approach to tax \\n We seek to pay our fair share of tax in the \\njurisdictions in which we operate and to \\nminimise the likelihood of customers using \\nour products to avoid or evade tax. Our \\napproach to tax and governance processes \\nis designed to achieve these goals. \\nWe have established a formal tax risk \\nmanagement framework, which is \\ndesigned to ensure that tax-motivated \\ntransactions or products are not adopted by \\nthe Group. Signicant investment has been \\nmade to strengthen our tax risk processes \\nand train sta to identify instances of \\npotential tax evasion. There remain areas \\nwhere further improvements are required \\nand we are working to address these.\\nWith respect to our own taxes, we \\n are guided by the following principles:\\n We are committed to applying both \\n the letter and spirit of the law in all \\njurisdictions in which we operate. \\n This includes adherence to a variety \\n of measures arising from the OECD \\n Base Erosion and Prot Shifting \\n (BEPS) initiative. \\n We seek to have open and transparent \\nrelationships with all tax authorities. \\n As with any group of our size and \\ncomplexity, a number of areas of \\ndiering interpretation or disputes with \\ntax authorities exist at any point in time. \\n We work with the local tax authorities \\n to try to agree and resolve these in a \\ntimely manner.\\n We have reduced the number of legal \\nentities located in very low or nil tax \\njurisdictions from 121 at the beginning \\n of 2015 to 46 by the end of 2018. This \\nprocess will continue throughout 2019 \\nand 2020, with the aim of ensuring that \\nthe HSBC entities remaining in such \\njurisdictions are regulated entities \\nessential for conducting business.\\nWith respect to our customers taxes, we \\nare guided by the following principles:\\n We have made considerable investment \\nimplementing processes designed to \\nincrease transparency and reduce the \\n risk of banking services being used to \\nfacilitate customer tax evasion and \\nnancial crime. These processes \\nincorporate requirements arising from \\nexternal tax transparency initiatives \\nincluding the US Foreign Account Tax \\nCompliance Act, the OECD Standard \\n for Automatic Exchange of Financial \\nAccount Information (the Common \\nReporting Standard), and the UK \\nlegislation on the corporate criminal \\noence of failing to prevent the \\n facilitation of tax evasion.\\n We have processes in place to help \\nensure that tax-motivated products are \\nnot provided to our customers.\\n \\nFor further details on our approach to \\n nancial crime and what steps we have \\n taken, see pages 37 to 39.\\n Our tax contributions\\nAs highlighted below, in addition to paying \\n$7.0bn of our own tax liabilities during \\n2018, we collected taxes of $7.6bn on \\nbehalf of governments around the world. \\n A more detailed geographical breakdown \\nof the taxes paid in 2018 is provided on \\npage 65 of the HSBC Holdings plc \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2018\\n.42A responsible business culture\\n\\nRespecting \\n human rights \\nBusiness does not exist in isolation: it \\n is part of communities and serves the \\npeople. We recognise the duty of states \\nto protect human rights and the role \\nplayed by business in respecting them, \\n in line with the UN Guiding Principles \\n(UNGPs) Protect, Respect and Remedy \\nframework. We have signed, or \\nexpressed support for, a number of \\ninternational codes, as set out in our \\n2015 Statement on Human Rights.\\nIn 2018, we set up a Human Rights \\nSteering Committee, which is overseeing \\nthe development of our approach to \\nhuman rights. This approach will \\nincorporate new recommendations from \\ninitiatives such as the OECDs general \\n Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible \\nBusiness Conduct, published in May 2018. \\nWe primarily reect human rights \\nconsiderations as they apply to our \\npeople, our suppliers and our customers. \\nSome examples are provided below.\\nEmployees\\nWe are committed to an inclusive \\n culture where our people can be \\ncondent that their views matter, their \\nworkplace is an environment free from \\nbias, discrimination and harassment, \\n and where they can see that \\nadvancement is based on merit. This \\ncommitment reects the provisions of \\nboth the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights (the UDHR) and the International \\nLabour Organization Declaration on \\nFundamental Principles and Rights at \\nWork (the ILO Declaration), including \\nfreedom of association. For further \\ndetails on the diversity of our workforce, \\nsee page 24.\\nSuppliers\\nWe expect our suppliers to uphold \\nhuman rights in carrying out their \\nbusiness, reecting the UDHR and ILO \\nDeclaration principles. Our ethical and \\nenvironmental code of conduct for \\nsuppliers requires them to respect the \\nhuman rights of their employees and the \\ncommunities in which they operate, and \\ncomply with all relevant legislation, \\nregulations and directives. During 2018, \\nwe undertook a risk-mapping exercise \\n to identify the most salient human rights \\nrisks in our supply chain, particularly \\nthose relating to modern slavery and \\nhuman tracking. \\nCustomers\\nThe principal aim of the UNGPs is to \\nprevent human rights abuses. We seek \\n to ensure that the nancial services we \\nprovide to our customers do not result \\n in an unacceptable impact on people \\n or the environment. We are a signatory \\nto the Equator Principles, which are \\nunderpinned by the International Finance \\nCorporations Performance Standards, \\nand which focus on issues including land \\nrights, child labour, forced labour, and \\n the rights of indigenous and local \\ncommunities. We work with our \\ncustomers to help them improve their \\nsustainability practices. Additionally, our \\nnancial crime teams actively seek to \\nidentify the proceeds of potential human \\nrights abuses to inform law enforcement \\nand take bad actors out of the nancial \\nsystem. A case study on this is contained \\nin our Modern Slavery Act statement. \\n  Modern Slavery Act\\nOur statement under the UKs \\n 2015 Modern Slavery and Human \\nTracking Act gives details of our \\n work in combating these particularly \\negregious human rights abuses. We are \\nraising awareness with our customers \\n in selected sectors and regions as part \\n of our annual credit review processes. \\nWe are educating our own colleagues \\ndirectly through training and indirectly \\nthrough communications. \\nStakeholder engagement\\nWe remain committed to developing our \\napproach to managing human rights risks \\nas they aect rights holders. We attended \\nthe UN Business and Human Rights \\nForum in November 2018 and continued \\nour involvement with the Thun Group, an \\ninformal group of bank representatives \\nthat provides guidance on how the \\nUNGPs should be applied across banking \\nactivities. We support the UN Global \\nCompacts promotion of sustainable \\n and socially responsible policies, and \\nparticipate in the UK Chapters Modern \\nSlavery Act working group. \\nIn 2018, we had contact with ve civil \\nsociety groups where human rights \\nabuses were raised. These abuses were \\nalleged to have been committed by \\nHSBC customers. We investigate \\ncredible allegations of human rights \\nviolations as they are reported to us \\n via engagement with stakeholders. If \\nrequired, particularly serious issues \\nultimately pass to the Group \\nManagement Board. \\n 43\\nWe believe that the global economy \\n is better served by customers being \\n part of the regulated nancial system. \\n In support of this, we carried out \\n a number of initiatives in 2018 to \\n increase access to nancial services. \\n Our approach to nancial inclusion \\n is focused on engaging with partners \\n to raise industry standards improving \\naccessibility of products and services \\nand investing in educational content. \\nWe acknowledge that increasing \\nnancial inclusion is a continuing \\n eort, and there are a number of \\ninitiatives we will be focusing on \\n in 2019. These include: \\n implementing the UK Finance Financial \\nAbuse Code of Practice, which aims to \\nincrease awareness for victims, potential \\nvictims, families and colleagues to \\nrecognise the signs of nancial abuse \\nand to oer support where needed and \\n launching our Age Friendly Banking \\ninitiative in Hong Kong to assist seniors \\nto better understand key concepts \\n and services such as third-party carer \\nbanking, digital banking and scam \\nprevention. \\nSupporting nancial inclusion \\n We work with trade associations, \\ngovernments and regulators to identify \\nbarriers to nancial inclusion and nd \\nways to improve standards and share \\nbest practice. For example, in 2018: \\n We chaired trade body UK Finances \\nFinancial Inclusion and Capability \\nworking group and were involved with its \\nVulnerability sub-group we were part of \\na cross-Whitehall working group, which \\nbrings together the government, banks \\nand policymakers to develop strategies \\non how UK banks can safely transfer \\nWe believe that in order for people to \\naccess and make the most of nancial \\nservices they need to understand how \\n to use them eectively to establish and \\ngrow their wealth. To deliver this in 2018:\\n We delivered more than 1,000 nancial \\nwell-being seminars in the US, UK, \\nMexico, Singapore and Australia, \\nreaching more than 26,000 people \\nincluding more than 2,100 HSBC \\nfunds to high risk and sanctioned \\njurisdictions and we provided \\norganisational and stang support, \\nincluding the chairmanship, to the \\n UK Financial Inclusion Commission.\\n In Asia-Pacic we hosted an insurance \\nindustry event as part of the annual Out \\nLeadership summit, where we shared \\nchanges made in our business to \\nrecognise modern family relationships, \\nand encouraged the industry to \\nbecome more inclusive in their \\nproducts and services. \\nemployees, as part our RBWMs \\n Your Financierge service.\\n We began refreshing the content we \\nshare on our public websites, including \\nintroducing guides to modern money \\non our UK site. \\n We launched an online platform in the \\nUS with EVERFI to help our customers \\nand communities better understand \\nday-to-day money management and \\npreparing for the future. \\nWe believe that diversity helps us to full \\nour potential. We apply this philosophy to \\nour products and channels to help ensure \\nthey are inclusive and accessible for \\nindividuals and SMEs. To deliver this in 2018:\\n We improved our digital accessibility in \\n10 of our retail banking markets, so that \\nmore customers can access online \\nbanking. We also made physical services \\nmore accessible by starting a barrier-free \\nbanking programme in Hong Kong to \\nupgrade our branch and ATM networks. \\n We oered low- or no-fee banking \\nservices in selected markets for \\nindividuals who may not qualify for our \\nproducts. These services are provided \\nthrough basic accounts or waivers of \\nminimum balance requirements. \\n We expanded the beneciary denitions \\nof our life insurance policies in Hong \\nKong to recognise a broader range of \\nfamily relationships such as stepchildren \\nand same-sex couples. \\n We helped people experiencing cognitive \\ndecline access and maintain banking \\nservices through our Independence \\nService initiative in the UK, and through \\nour new Living with Dementia \\nprogramme in Hong Kong. \\n We expanded the use of third-party \\nalliances in Mexico so our customers \\nnow have 10% more locations where \\nthey can deposit cash and pay bills. \\n We announced a 12bn fund to lend to \\nSMEs in the UK, and continued to be a \\nshareholder in BGF Group plc (BGF), \\nformerly the Business Growth Fund. \\nBGF provides patient equity capital to \\nsupport SMEs across the UK and \\nIreland.In 2018, the Canadian Business \\nGrowth Fund, which we helped to \\npromote and in which we are an \\ninvestor, made its rst investments. \\nEngagement with partners\\nAccess to nancial education content\\nAccess to products and services\\n44A responsible business culture\\n\\nAdditional \\n information\\n45\\nThis \\nESG Update\\n may contain projections, \\nestimates, forecasts, targets, opinions, \\nprospects, results, returns and forward-\\nlooking statements with respect to the \\nnancial condition, results of operations, \\ncapital position, strategy and business of \\nthe Group, which can be identied by the \\nuse of forward-looking terminology such \\nas may, will, should, expect, \\nanticipate, project, estimate, seek, \\nintend, target or believe or the \\nnegatives thereof or other variations \\nthereon or comparable terminology \\n(together, forward-looking statements), \\nincluding the strategic priorities and any \\nnancial, investment and capital targets \\ndescribed herein.

Ongoing and proactive engagement with these groups makes our company stronger and better \\n\\ninformed. It helps us gain valuable insight into our stakeholders perspectives and the topics that matter to them. It better enables us to \\n\\ndevelop products, services and programs that are responsive to their needs. This engagement also allows us to share information about our \\n\\nrms strategy, practices and performance.\\nResponsibility for engaging with stakeholder groups is widely shared across our rms lines of business and corporate functions, and we \\nengage through numerous channels. For example:\\nShareholders \\nWe interact and communicate with shareholders through our \\n\\nInvestor Day, quarterly earnings calls, Securities and Exchange \\n\\nCommission lings, Annual Report and Proxy Statement, \\n\\nannual meeting of shareholders, investor conferences, web \\n\\ncommunications and other forums. We conduct a formal \\n\\nshareholder outreach program focused on topics including \\n\\ncorporate governance, the rm's strategy and performance and \\n\\nmatters related to the Proxy Statement. In these meetings, we \\n\\nsolicit shareholders perspectives and share information about \\n\\nour management of a range of matters, including ESG topics. \\n\\nFor example, the main areas of focus of our fall 2019 meetings \\n\\nwere executive compensation, corporate governance and climate \\n\\nchange strategy. After each of these outreach programs, we \\n\\nshare feedback from our investors with our Board. In 2019 \\n\\nwe reached out to our top 100 and select other shareholders, \\n\\ntogether representing over 50% of our outstanding common \\n\\nstock, and received feedback from shareholders representing \\n\\napproximately 45% of the rms outstanding common stock \\n\\nacross more than 60 engagements.\\nWe also engage in dialogue outside of these more formal \\nchannels. These engagements provide us with useful feedback, \\n\\nwhich we consider when developing the strategic direction for \\n\\nthe rm.Employees \\nWe share information with our employees and gather their input \\n\\nthrough our global Employee Opinion Surveys, regular town \\n\\nhall and small group meetings, blogs and newsletters, online \\n\\nsuggestion tools via our intranet and other forums. We also have \\n\\na variety of mechanisms through which employees can fulll \\n\\ntheir obligation to report any known or suspected violation of \\n\\nour Code of Conduct, company policies or laws that govern our \\n\\nbusiness. This includes our toll-free Code Reporting Hotline, which \\n\\nis operated by an independent third party and oers translation \\n\\nservices. Employees can contact the hotline to report concerns 24 \\n\\nhours a day, seven days a week. \\nRegulators and Policymakers \\nWe strive to maintain an open, ongoing dialogue with our global \\n\\nsupervisory regulators and a broad array of other policymakers. \\n\\nOur senior leaders and Directors commit a signicant amount \\n\\nof their time to meeting with our regulators and policymakers, \\n\\nproviding opportunities for us to hear rsthand about their \\n\\npriorities and to keep them informed about developments in our \\n\\nbusinesses. In addition, our businesses and control functions \\n\\nengage with regulatorsfor example, through exams and \\n\\ncontinuous monitoring, regular meetings and ad hoc requests. We \\n\\nshare reports with regulators on a range of matters. We also seek \\n\\nfeedback about whether they are getting the right level, quality \\n\\nand frequency of information.\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n6\\nCustomers and Clients \\nWe use multiple channels to solicit and respond to our consumer \\nbanking customers feedback about our products, services and \\n\\norganization as a whole.

Equally critical, we seek to create and \\n\\nreinforce a strong and healthy culture in which employees feel respected and empowered to do what is \\n\\nright for all of our stakeholders.\\nLeadership and \\nGovernance\\n Outstanding people, strong leadership and eective governance and controls are the foundation of our success. Our senior management \\nteam develops the companys strategic direction and oversees its execution, while our Board of Directors provides oversight of \\n\\nmanagements performance. In addition, senior management and the Board are charged with demonstrating, communicating and \\n\\nreinforcing the companys commitment to doing business in accordance with our corporate standards and Business Principles.\\nBoard of Directors\\nOur Directors are a diverse group who bring a strong combination of executive experience and skills aligned with our business and \\n\\nstrategy. Apart from our CEO, all of our Directors are independent, under the standards established by the New York Stock Exchange \\n\\nand the rms Corporate Governance Principles. We have a Lead Independent Director who is appointed annually by the independent \\n\\nDirectors and facilitates independent Board oversight of management. At our 2019 annual meeting, our shareholders elected to our \\n\\nBoard 11 Directors, including two women Directors and two black Directors. In 2020, two of our Directors decided to retire when their \\n\\nterms expire and one new Director has been nominated for election. Of the 10 individuals nominated at our 2020 annual meeting on May \\n\\n19, 2020, three are women and one is black.\\nThe rms Corporate Governance Principles and the charters of the Boards ve principal standing committees establish a framework \\nfor the governance of the Board and oversight of the rm. Among their responsibilities, the committees oversee a range of matters \\n\\npertaining to ESG topics. For example:\\n The Compensation & Management Development Committee \\n\\n(CMDC) reviews and approves the rms compensation and \\n\\nbenet programs and oversees the rms culture, which includes \\n\\nreviewing feedback from employees and cultural initiatives \\n\\nand updates from management regarding signicant conduct \\n\\nissues and related employee actions. As part of its oversight \\n\\nresponsibilities, the committee also reviews the relationship \\n\\namong risk, risk management and compensation in light of the \\n\\nrms objectives, including the avoidance of practices that would \\n\\nencourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking. \\n The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee provides \\n\\noversight of the governance of the Board of Directors, including \\n\\nevaluation and recommendation of Director candidates. JPMorgan \\n\\nChase seeks Director candidates who uphold the highest standards, \\n\\nare committed to the rms values and are strong, independent \\n\\nstewards of the long-term interests of shareholders, employees, \\n\\ncustomers, suppliers and the communities in which we work. \\n\\nIn addition to considering candidates who have the combined \\n\\nprofessional skills, experience, personal qualities, balance of \\n\\ntenure and collegiality needed for an eective and engaged \\n\\nBoard, the Board looks for individuals who will contribute diverse \\n\\nviewpoints and perspectives to enhance its independent oversight.\\n The Risk Committee provides oversight of managements \\n\\nresponsibility to implement an eective global risk management \\n\\nframework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage \\n\\nthe rms risks. The committee approves applicable risk policies \\n\\nand reviews certain associated frameworks, analysis and \\n\\nreporting established by management. \\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nADVANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n8JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n\\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of \\nmanagements responsibilities to ensure that there is an \\n\\neective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard \\n\\nthe assets and income of the rm and maintain compliance with \\n\\nthe rms ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and \\n\\nwith laws and regulations. \\nThe Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the \\n\\nrms positions and practices on matters such as community \\n\\ninvestment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices \\n and other issues that reec\\nt the rms values and impact \\n its reputation. \\nOur annual Proxy Statement\\n includes details about the membership \\nand responsibilities of these committees.\\nManagement \\nThe design of our management structure is intended to \\n\\nencourage eective leadership that is consistent with our \\n\\ncorporate standards and promotes a strong corporate culture. \\n\\nWe manage our rm on a line-of-business basis, while also \\n\\nmaintaining strong corporate functions and appropriate \\n\\ngovernance of our subsidiaries. Within each line of business, the \\n\\nmanagement structure mirrors that of the rm as a whole. \\nOur rms most senior management body is the Operating \\nCommittee, which is responsible for developing and implementing \\n\\ncorporate strategy and managing operations. As of December 31, \\n\\n2019, women held 50% of the seats on the Operating Committee.\\nExecutive Compensation \\nOur rms compensation philosophy is designed to be responsive to \\n\\nand aligned with shareholders interests and encourages a shared \\n\\nsuccess culture in support of our Business Principles and strategic \\n\\nframework. Our approach is driven by our recognition that the \\n\\nlong-term success of our rm depends in large measure on the \\n\\ntalents of our employees and alignment of their compensation with \\n\\nperformance, business strategy and sustained shareholder value.\\nThe CMDC of the Board maintains independent oversight of our \\n\\ncompensation programs, including executive compensation. In \\n\\ndetermining compensation for Operating Committee members, \\n\\nthe CMDC uses a balanced and discretionary approach to assess \\n\\nperformance against four broad dimensions over a sustained period \\n\\nof time: (i) Business Results; (ii) Risk, Controls & Conduct, including \\n\\nfeedback received from the rms risk and control professionals; \\n\\n(iii) Client/Customer/Stakeholder, including our engagement in \\n\\ncommunities; and (iv) Teamwork & Leadership, including creating \\n\\na diverse, inclusive and respectful environment and developing \\n\\nemployees, managers and leaders. These performance dimensions \\n\\nconsider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive \\n\\nsustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk, controls and \\n\\nconduct objectives.\\nThe intent of our compensation program is to incentivize long-\\nterm, sustainable decision making and to hold individuals \\n\\naccountable, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues \\n\\nthat negatively impact business performance or the rms \\n\\nreputation. We maintain policies and procedures that enable us to \\n\\ntake prompt and proportionate actions with respect to accountable \\n\\nindividuals, including (i) reduction or elimination of annual incentive \\n\\ncompensation; (ii) cancellation of unvested awards; (iii) clawback of \\n\\npreviously paid compensation; and (iv) other employment-related \\n\\nactions, including termination of employment.\\nWe regularly review our compensation program and actively seek \\nout and consider feedback in making potential changes. In 2019, 72% \\n\\nof our shareholders voted in favor of our annual advisory resolution \\n\\nto approve executive compensation. In response to shareholder \\n\\nfeedback, the CMDC made enhancements to certain features of \\n\\nthe long-term equity awards made to the Operating Committee for \\n\\n2019, including revising the payout calculation methodology, setting \\n\\nappropriately rigorous absolute payout thresholds and updating the \\n\\nrelative payout scale. The CMDC also made several enhancements to \\n\\nour executive compensation disclosures. Our \\nProxy Statement\\n has a \\n\\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section that includes further \\n\\ndetails of our executive pay program.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n9INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nADVANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nOur Corporate Culture \\nHaving clear and consistent policies and processes is essential to sound governance, but creating a corporate culture that reinforces and \\nrewards adherence to them is equally vital. Our eorts focus on fostering an environment where all employees uphold the highest ethical \\n\\nstandards and our Business Principles in all of their engagements. We reinforce these expectations through various channels and by \\n\\nencouraging our senior leaders to communicate clearly and frequently with employees.  \\nOur eorts are also focused on promoting a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe and empowered at work. This includes \\nhaving in place employee training and protocols for preventing, reporting and addressing behavior that is not in line with our Business \\n\\nPrinciples and standards. The rm prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports a concern or assists with an inquiry or investigation.  \\nAt the Board level, the CMDC provides oversight of the governance framework of our rmwide culture, including receiving updates from \\nmanagement regarding signicant conduct issues. In addition, the CMDC holds a periodic joint session with the Risk Committee in which \\n\\nDirectors are briefed on culture- and conduct-related matters.\\nOur Control Environment \\nOur control agenda is a top priority for the rm, and we devote signicant resources to adhering and adapting to the substantial \\n\\nnumber of regulatory expectations and reporting requirements that guide our industry. We have a culture and infrastructure \\n\\nthat emphasize compliance and issue escalation and remediation, as well as checks and balances designed to prevent issues and \\n\\naddress those identied before they become problems. We regularly engage regulators in dialogue as we develop appropriate \\n\\nremediation plans.  \\nOur rm continuously seeks ways to strengthen our control \\n\\nenvironment and to simplify and appropriately mitigate risk in our \\n\\noperations. We dedicate signicant nancial and human resources \\n\\nto managing these eorts across the company.  \\nOur control environment, which is supported by other functions, \\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal, is structured as \\n\\nfollows, and additional details are available in our \\nAnnual Report\\n.Lines of Business Our rms lines of business are each responsible for identifying and \\n\\naddressing risks within their respective businesses and operating \\n\\nwithin a sound control environment. The Control Management \\n\\nfunction, which consists of control managers within each of the lines \\n\\nof business and corporate functions, provides dedicated support \\n\\nto business leaders. Control managers, jointly accountable with \\n\\nbusiness executives, are charged with enhancing the rms control \\n\\nenvironment by promoting early operational risk identication \\n\\nand assessment, eectively designing and evaluating controls and \\n\\ndeveloping solutions to mitigate risk. This structure is designed to \\n\\nenable the rm to detect control problems quickly, escalate issues \\n\\npromptly and engage other stakeholders to understand common \\n\\nthemes and interdependencies among the various parts of the rm. \\nThe rms overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the \\n\\nassociated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests \\n\\nof its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety \\n\\nand soundness of the rm. Risks are generally categorized in the \\n\\nfollowing risk types:\\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation \\nassociated with poorly designed or failed business plans or \\n\\ninadequate response to changes in the operating environment.\\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default \\n\\nor change in credit prole of a client, counterparty or customer; \\n\\nor loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on \\n\\ninvestments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit \\n\\nrisk and investment portfolio risk.\\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the eect of changes \\n\\nin market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange \\n\\nrates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied \\n\\nvolatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the \\n\\nshort and long term.\\nOperational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome \\n\\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or \\n\\nsystems; human factors; or external events impacting the rms \\n\\nprocesses or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal and \\n\\nestimations and model risk.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nADVANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n10\\nConduct Risk Management\\nConduct risk is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, \\nimpact the integrity of the markets in which the rm operates or compromise the rms reputation. Our rm has an established \\n\\npolicy framework for the governance, identication, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting of conduct \\n\\nrisk within the rm, as well as mechanisms to provide oversight of the rms conduct initiatives and to escalate systemic conduct risk \\n\\nissues when appropriate. Each line of business and corporate function is accountable for identifying and managing conduct risk within its \\n\\noperations, and multiple Board committees share oversight of conduct risk. \\nOur Code of Conduct (Code) sets forth the rms expectations for all of our employees when it comes to maintaining a safe, productive, \\ndiverse, professional, collegial and secure work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. All new hires \\n\\nare assigned Code training and all employees are required to arm their compliance with the Code periodically. Each member of the \\n\\nBoard also periodically arms his or her compliance with the Code. \\nIndependent Risk Management \\nIndependent Risk Management, which consists of the Risk \\n\\nManagement and Compliance organizations, sets and oversees the \\n\\nrisk management structure for the rm, including the denition of \\n\\npolicies and standards. These organizations operate independently \\n\\nfrom the lines of business.\\nInternal Audit \\nInternal Audit, a function independent of the lines of business \\n\\nand Risk Management and Compliance, tests and evaluates \\n\\nthe rms risk governance and management, as well as its \\n\\ninternal control processes. This function brings a systematic \\n\\nand disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the \\n\\neectiveness of the rms governance, risk management and \\n\\ninternal control processes. \\nCybersecurity\\nCybersecurity is one of the biggest threats facing the global nancial \\n\\nsystem, and it continues to be a top priority for the rm. Our \\n\\nstrategy is designed to securely enable new business and technology \\n\\ninitiatives while maintaining a relentless focus on protecting the \\n\\nrm, our clients and customers and our third-party partners \\n\\nand vendors. We devote signicant resources to protecting and \\n\\ncontinuously improving the security of our systems, and we partner \\n\\nwith leading technology companies to identify solutions to meet the \\n\\nfast-evolving threat landscape.\\nGlobal Financial Crimes Compliance\\nGlobal nancial crime has signicant adverse societal \\n\\nimpacts and undermines condence in the nancial \\n\\nsystem, which is why our rm dedicates signicant \\n\\nresources to ghting it. JPMorgan Chase is committed to \\n\\nparticipating in international eorts to combat money \\n\\nlaundering and the funding of terrorist activities.

We also educate, train \\n\\nand test all employees on cybersecurity vigilance because we view \\n\\nevery employee as our rst line of defense.\\nWe understand cybersecuritys potential to impact global nancial \\nstability and we are focused on the rms role in building and \\n\\nmaintaining systemic resiliency. We are a leader in the Financial \\n\\nServices Information Sharing & Analysis Center, which is an \\n\\nintelligence-sharing cooperative for the nancial services sector. \\n\\nIts nearly 7,000 members share intelligence, best practices and \\n\\nexercises to better secure the sector for the benet of the public \\n\\nand the resiliency and integrity of nancial institutions. Our rm \\n\\nalso helped drive the creation of the Financial Systemic Analysis \\n\\nand Resilience Center, which is an industry-funded nonprot whose \\n\\nmission is to increase the resilience of the systems that underpin the \\n\\nU.S. nancial services sector. \\nCollaborating and cooperating with government agencies and \\nregulators is vital to eective cybersecurity. We maintain open \\n\\nlines of communication with government representatives and law \\n\\nenforcement agencies to share relevant information. In addition, \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase is a leading voice on a global industry workstream \\n\\non regulatory harmonization, seeking to streamline the fragmented \\n\\ncybersecurity regulatory environment that is currently a patchwork \\n\\nof dierent standards, frameworks and requirements from over 150 \\n\\nglobal regulators. Our goal is to enable more ecient and eective \\n\\ncybersecurity supervisory oversight, while also helping to increase \\n\\nsecurity and resiliency.\\nPolitical Engagement and \\nPublic Policy\\nJPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate \\ncitizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy \\n\\nand informed democracy through civic and community \\n\\ninvolvement. Our business is subject to extensive laws and \\n\\nregulations, and changes to such laws can signicantly \\n\\naect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we \\n\\nincur. Because of the impact public policy can have on our \\n\\nbusinesses, employees, communities and customers, we \\n\\nengage with policymakers on a range of issuesincluding \\n\\nbanking, nancial services, cybersecurity, workforce \\n\\ndevelopment, small business, tax, trade and inclusive \\n\\neconomic growth, among othersto advance and protect \\n\\nthe long-term interests of the rm. In addition, in 2019 we \\n\\nlaunched the JPMorgan Chase \\nPolicy\\nCenter to develop and \\nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions that \\n\\ndrive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the \\n\\nworld. The \\nPolicy\\nCenters rst focus is removing barriers to \\nemployment for people with a criminal background. \\nThe rm belongs to a number of trade associations that \\nadvocate on major public policy issues of importance \\n\\nto the rm and the communities we serve. The rms \\n\\nparticipation as a member of these associations comes \\n\\nwith the understanding that we may not always agree with \\n\\nall the positions of an association or its other members, \\n\\nand that we are committed to voicing our concerns \\n\\nas appropriate. The Public Responsibility Committee \\n\\nprovides oversight of our positions and practices on public \\n\\nresponsibility matters, including signicant policies and \\n\\npractices regarding political contributions, major lobbying \\n\\npriorities and principal trade association memberships. \\nWe aim to operate with the highest standards of public \\ntransparency in political spending.

We strive to provide \\n\\nour clients and customers with exceptional service in everything we do.  \\nThis section focuses principally on our CCB business, which serves consumers and small \\nbusinesses across the U.S. under the Chase brand. We help our customers manage \\n\\ntheir money, purchase homes and vehicles, save and invest for the future, start and \\n\\ngrow businesses and achieve their financial goals. We do so by using our expertise to \\n\\nhelp our customers make the most of their money and by continually innovating and \\n\\ndeveloping products and services to enable them to bank however they choosefrom \\n\\ntheir mobile phone, on their computer, at an ATM or at a Chase branch. \\nSince 2018, our firm has entered 16 new markets and opened more than 90 of the \\n400 new Chase branches we are planning across the U.S. as part of a nationwide \\n\\nmarket expansion effort. The new branches give us a presence in 38 states and \\n\\nWashington, D.C., as of year-end 2019.\\nWho We Serve:\\n63 million households \\n4 million small business customers \\n52 million activ\\ne digital users, includin\\ng \\n37 million active on mobile\\n2019At a Glance: \\nOriginated $105 billion in mortgages \\nOpened 8 million credit card acc\\nounts \\nReceived 35% of all check deposits \\n\\nthrough mobile phones\\nProc\\nessed an average of $3 billion in \\ncredit and debit payments every day \\nHelping Customers Make the \\nMost of Their Money \\nServing 63 million households, we have a deep understanding of the financial lives of \\nconsumers. We are using that insight to develop affordable, innovative and scalable \\n\\nproducts to help customers strengthen their financial health. \\nOne way we do this is by offering products designed to make it easier for our \\ncustomers to save and invest. For example, in early 2019, we introduced our low-\\n\\nfee Chase Secure Banking\\nSM\\n account (see p. 17), as well as Autosave, which lets \\ncustomers set up automatic transfers to their savings accounts and monitor progress \\n\\nthrough a savings dashboard. A total of 1.4 million customers used Autosave in \\n\\n2019, transferring $1.5 billion to their savings accounts. Also in 2019, we launched \\n\\nMy Chase Loan, which gives customers a hassle-free way to use the available credit \\n\\non their credit cards at a lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and with fewer fees \\n\\nthan a typical personal loan or cash advance. In addition, we empower all types \\n\\nof investors to build their savings and grow their wealth through our You Invest\\nSM\\ndigital investment platform. Approximately 90% of You Invest\\nSM\\n clients are first-time \\ninvestors with Chase.    \\nWe also created Credit Journey\\nSM\\n, a free, online tool to help consumers track and \\nmanage their credit scores. All consumers, whether or not they are Chase customers, \\ncan check their credit score at any time and receive alerts about changes, as well as \\n\\nlearn what affects their score and find advice on how to improve it. By year-end 2019, \\n\\n22 million people had enrolled in Credit Journey\\nSM\\n.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n13INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADV\\nANCING\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nSupporting Small \\nBusinesses\\nSmall businesses are vital engines of economic growth and \\nopportunity, and our firm has been a longtime leader in small \\n\\nbusiness banking. During 2019, we originated over 1.1 million small \\n\\nbusiness loans for a total of $18.4 billion in the states where we \\n\\nhave a branch presence, an increase of 19% in capital extended \\n\\nfrom the year before.\\nWe know that minority, women, veteran and other underserved \\nentrepreneurs face distinct barriers to starting and growing their \\n\\nbusinesses, so we have a number of efforts designed to help \\n\\nthem get access to the capital, expertise and networks crucial for \\n\\nsuccess. For example, through our Women on the Move global \\n\\ninitiative, we are helping women start and grow businesses (see \\n\\np. 21), including a goal to provide $10 billion in credit to women \\n\\nbusiness owners through 2021. By the end of 2019, we had \\n\\nextended approximately $4 billion toward this goal, putting us \\n\\nahead of pace. \\nIn addition, we have committed $150 million in philanthropic \\ncapital to help underserved entrepreneurs build and grow their \\n\\nbusinesses. Through the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (see p. 25), \\n\\nwe support community lending organizations that provide \\n\\nminority entrepreneurs with access to capital, education and \\n\\nother resources. \\nWe are also using our global purchasing power to support \\ndiverse suppliers, spending more than $2 billion annually with \\n\\ncompanies owned and operated by historically underrepresented \\n\\ngroups, many of which are small businesses. Our firm is proud \\n\\nto be a member of The Billion Dollar Roundtablea nonprofit \\n\\nthat recognizes corporations that spend at least $1 billion with \\n\\nminority and woman-owned suppliersfor our commitment to \\n\\nsupplier diversity.\\nEngaging with \\nCustomers\\nWe regularly engage with our customers, consumer groups and \\nother stakeholders with a goal of developing products, services \\n\\nand approaches that are responsive to their needs and address \\n\\nthe issues that matter most to them. We have established \\n\\nforums, known as Chase Advisory Panels, for local, regional and \\n\\nnational stakeholders to share with our senior executives their \\n\\nperspectives on community development needs, public policy \\n\\nand regulatory issues. In addition, we conduct hundreds of \\n\\nmeetings annually with community-based organizations. \\nWe solicit customers direct feedback on their experiences and \\nneeds through a range of channels, including in person at our \\n\\nbranches, through our website, via social media and customer \\n\\nsatisfaction surveys. In addition, we collect customer feedback \\n\\nthrough external media and ratings agencies. We take this feedback \\n\\nseriously and use it to improve our approach and offerings.\\nHelping Our Small Business \\nCustomers Weather the Crisis\\nWe know how important small businesses are to their \\ncommunitiesand how much they rely on cash flow and \\n\\naccess to capital. So, when the COVID-19 crisis hit, we \\n\\nquickly took steps to support our small business customers, \\n\\nincluding allowing them to defer payments on loans, lines \\n\\nof credit and business credit cards. We are also providing \\n\\nmuch-needed capital by accelerating access to funding and \\n\\nextending new loans for our small business customers. We \\n\\nare working to help as many of our customers as possible \\n\\nreceive loans through the Small Business Administrations \\n\\nPaycheck Protection Program. In addition, we immediately \\n\\nbegan deploying philanthropic capital to support vulnerable \\n\\nand underserved small businesses around the world.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n14INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nTreating Customers Fairly\\nIn order to earn and maintain the trust of our customers, we must treat them fairly and be clear and transparent in how we communicate \\nand engage with them. We work to do this by having policies and procedures aimed at simplifying our disclosures, products and services \\nand operations; aligning our sales practices with our customers interests; and taking rigorous measures to safeguard the privacy of \\ncustomers information.\\nWe regularly review and look for ways to make it easier for customers to navigate our full range of products and services available across \\nour branch network. In addition, we are reevaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefits and taking \\nsteps aimed at ensuring the exercise of employee discretion in product accessibility works as intended.\\nProviding Fair and Transparent Marketing\\nWe want our customers to make informed choices about their \\nfinances and banking options, and we empower them to do so \\nby working to provide clear, concise and transparent information \\nabout our products and services. To deliver on this objective, \\nin 2019 we established the Disclosure Center of Excellence, a \\ncontrol team driving the consistent use of disclosures across our \\nCCB and AWM businesses. The team is responsible for ensuring \\nthat these businesses have access to up-to-date disclosure \\nlanguage that meets regulatory requirements and firmwide \\nguidelines so they can best serve their clients and customers. \\nAligning Employees Incentives with \\nCustomers Interests\\nOur objective is to provide our customers with the right products \\nand services to meet their financial needs, and we train, assess \\nand reward our employees accordingly. Every year, we train \\nour bankers on our customer-centered policies, procedures and \\ncontrols, and we evaluate their performance on these metrics, \\nalongside revenue and profitability. \\nWe reward bankers for providing customers with a positive \\noverall experience and products and services they need and use. \\nWe also review our sales practices, including culture, incentive \\nplans, controls assessments and feedback received from \\n\\ncustomers and employees through various channels, including \\nour employee Code Reporting Hotline. By merging all of this \\nfeedback, we help safeguard our reputation and align employee \\nperformance with the best interests of our customers.\\nProtecting the Elderly and Vulnerable \\nfrom Financial Abuse \\nWe continue our work to increase awareness about potential \\nfinancial abuse affecting elderly and vulnerable populations. To \\nbetter protect our customers, we look for innovative solutions \\nin data analytics and machine learning, while also concentrating \\non ongoing training and communication with our frontline \\nemployees. We are also working with nonprofit organizations, \\nadvocacy groups, regulators, law enforcement and others to \\nexplore strategies and best practices for combating exploitation \\nof elderly and vulnerable customers.\\nSafeguarding Customer Privacy \\nand Data Security\\nProtecting our customers personal and financial information \\nis a priority for our firm. We have robust internal policies and \\nsecurity measures aimed at keeping our customers personal and \\nfinancial information safe, and we hold our suppliers and vendors \\nto high standards for data security. \\nConsumers want to know our firm is safeguarding their personal \\ninformation and to understand how it is used. We strive to \\nprovide customers with clear, user-friendly explanations of our \\nprivacy policies that explain how we collect, share, use and \\nprotect their information, and outline steps they can take to \\n\\nlimit the sharing of personal information. We protect customer \\ninformation through a wide range of technological, procedural \\nand physical security measures. In addition, our Code of Conduct \\nand related policies for ethical business conduct include specific \\nguidelines about how employees should safeguard customers \\nconfidential information. \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n15INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nWe are investing in enhanced data privacy and security solutions \\nto safeguard information shared via our suite of online and \\nmobile banking tools. For example, in 2019 we announced an \\nagreement with leading data aggregator Envestnet l Yodlee, \\nwhich gives Chase customers more visibility and control of their \\ndata. With the new agreement, Envestnet I Yodlee will send 100% \\nof its requests for Chase customer data through our firms secure \\nApplication Programming Interface (API). This will give customers \\ncontrol over what is shared and with whom, including enabling \\nthem to monitor every financial app that retrieves their data and \\nsee all linked accounts and which information they are sharing. \\nWe also continue to expand our usage of machine learning and \\nintelligent strategies to improve detection and mitigation of \\nfraud across our products and services. This technology allows \\nus to more accurately detect potentially fraudulent activity for \\nour customers and approve more legitimate transactions. Each \\nyear, we anticipate these systems will help prevent nearly one \\nmillion more fraudulent credit card transactions that may have \\npreviously been approved, while simultaneously approving nearly \\none million additional legitimate transactions that would have \\n\\nbeen incorrectly declined. These machine learning capabilities, \\nalong with other initiatives, have also enabled us to reduce our \\ncredit card fraud loss rate by approximately 50% since 2014.    \\nServing Low- and \\nModerate-Income \\nCustomers\\nWe are committed to developing products and services that \\nmeet the needs of all segments of our customer base, including \\nthose specifically designed to serve low- and moderate-income \\ncustomers. This includes taking steps to make homeownership \\nmore accessible; expanding our branch presence in low- and \\nmoderate-income neighborhoods; offering resources in our \\nbranches such as financial coaching; developing products that \\nprovide safe, high-quality and affordable ways to access banking \\nservices; and more. \\nExpanding Homeownership\\nIn 2018, our firm made a five-year commitment to finance $50 \\nbillion of mortgages in low- and moderate-income communities. \\nBy the end of 2019, we had financed $22 billion of those \\nmortgages, or 44% of the five-year goal. \\nWe continue to serve more low- and moderate-income customers \\nwith our DreaMaker mortgage, which allows buyers to make \\na down payment of as little as 3% and offers an affordable \\nmonthly payment. In 2019, DreaMaker accounted for 21% of our \\nhome-purchase mortgages. With DreaMaker, buyers can earn \\na $500 grant by completing a financial educational program to \\n\\nprepare them for homeownership. To reduce the cash required \\nfor closing costs and a down payment, we also offer a Chase \\nHomebuyer Grant of $2,500 to customers purchasing a home in \\nlow- or moderate-income census tracts across the U.S. More than \\n8,900 homebuyers benefited from this program in 2019. These \\nproducts and programs complement the suite of other affordable \\nloan products and programs we have long offered, including \\nFederal Housing Administration and U.S. Department of Veterans \\nAffairs mortgages.  \\nRecognizing that homeownership is not possible or desirable \\nfor some consumers, JPMorgan Chase is dedicated to creating \\nand preserving affordable rental housing for low-income \\ncommunities across the country. In 2018, we committed to lend \\n$7 billion over five years to commercial and nonprofit housing \\npartners to help maintain, rehabilitate and build affordable units. \\nBy the end of 2019, we had already lent $5.6 billion toward that \\ncommitment, including more than $3.3 billion in 2019 alone. \\nGrowing Our Branch Presence \\nOur retail bank branches are an important way that we serve \\nour customers and provide access to banking services. We plan \\nto open 30% of the 400 new branches in our market expansion \\nprogram in low- and moderate-income communities. We have \\na higher proportion of our branches and ATMs in low- and \\nmoderate-income communities across the country than the \\nindustry overall.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n16INTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nWe are also expanding resources available at our branches, such \\nas financial coaching and advice. For example, we are piloting \\n\\na new branch model aimed at making our branches community \\n\\ncenters. We opened the first one in the Harlem neighborhood of \\n\\nNew York City in 2019. The branch offers unique programming in \\n\\nmoney management and financial planning; digital coaching on \\n\\njob, small business and computer skills; a pop-up space for local \\n\\nsmall businesses; and a hub for us to showcase and test new \\n\\nretail banking technology before it rolls out nationwide. \\nBroadening Access to Banking Services\\nAnother crucial way we support low- and moderate-income \\n\\ncommunities is by striving to create products that provide safe, \\n\\nhigh-quality and affordable ways to access banking services. For \\n\\nexample, in early 2019, we launched Chase Secure Banking\\nSM\\n, a Bank On certified checking account.\\n1 For a flat monthly fee, \\ncustomers get all the benefits of banking with Chase without \\n\\ncheck-cashing fees, minimum balances to open an account or \\n\\noverdraft fees. \\nWe know that small businesses also play an essential role in \\ncreating jobs and generating economic opportunity, especially in \\n\\nlow- and moderate-income areas. In 2019, we made more than \\n\\n265,000 small business loanstotaling more than $4.5 billionin \\n\\nlow- and moderate-income communities. That is approximately \\n\\n19% of our total small business lending. \\nIn addition, we support technology-based innovations to improve \\nthe financial lives of low- and moderate-income Americans \\n\\nthrough the Financial Solutions Lab (see p. 26), managed by the \\n\\nFinancial Health Network in collaboration with founding partner, \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase.\\nAdditional Online Resources\\nAccessibility at Chase\\nAnnual Report\\nBusiness PrinciplesChase Privacy Policy\\nCOVID-19 Response\\nFinancial Health\\nJPMorgan Chase Institute\\nProxy Statement\\nSmall Business ExpansionFor additional information, please visit \\n\\nwww.jpmorganchase.com/ESG\\n.1Bank On is Cities for Financial Empowerment Funds standard for safe, aordable and appropriate accounts that meet the needs of low-income consumers.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n17\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\nInvesting in Our Employees\\nThe success of our rm is a direct reection of the talent of \\nour people. To attract and retain the diverse, high-performing \\n\\nworkforce we need, we make substantial investments in our \\n\\nemployees and provide them with opportunities to learn, \\n\\ndevelop and advance their careers. We seek to foster a strong \\n\\nculturebased on our core values of respect, integrity and \\n\\ninclusionwhere employees feel that they belong and where \\n\\nthey want to stay.\\nAs technological and other changes in our economy alter traditional career paths and \\nbusiness needs, one focus of our human capital strategy is building a future-ready \\n\\nworkforce that is prepared to adapt to the trends that are transforming jobs at our \\n\\nrm. This includes cultivating a culture that supports self-driven learning and giving \\n\\nour employees access to tools and training to build business-critical skills that will be in \\n\\ndemand at our rm in the future.  \\nAdvancing Diversity and Inclusion \\nacross Our Firm\\nJPMorgan Chase knows that having a diverse workforce consistent with the \\nglobal clients, customers and communities we serve is essential to our ability to \\n\\ndeliver the best solutions and be successful in the long term. Fostering diversity \\n\\nand inclusion has long been a focus for our firm, and we are proud of the \\n\\nprogress we have made.\\nWe recognize, however, that we have more work to do. After the media reported \\non alleged discrimination in our firm last year, we undertook a major effort to \\n\\nevaluate our policies, procedures and programs to ensure they are fair for all \\n\\nemployees and customers. We found opportunities to increase awareness about \\n\\nthe firm's Diversity and Inclusion strategy, and we identified a need to expand \\n\\nour diversity recruitment efforts to hire more diverse talent and to implement \\n\\nmandatory firmwide training. We are also taking steps to strengthen how we \\n\\nserve our customers by reviewing our full spectrum of consumer offerings to \\n\\nenhance access to our products and services, as well as increasing the diversity \\n\\nof the businesses with which we partner. We know that these and other efforts \\n\\nwe have underway to strengthen our culture demand ongoing work and \\n\\nsustained commitment.\\nTo drive performance and enhance transparency, we are expanding the \\nworkforce composition data we report and providing more information on our \\n\\nstrategy on the \\nDiversity and Inclusion\\n section of our website.\\nWho We Are: \\nKey 2019 Statistics\\nWe have nearly 257,000 employees \\nworking in 62 countries worldwide, \\n\\napproximately two-thirds of whom are \\n\\nbased in the U.S. \\nGender Demographics\\nGlobal Workforce\\n51%   \\n49%\\nOperating Committee\\n50%   50%Management Team\\n75%   \\n25%\\nCampus & Internship Class\\n58%   \\n42%\\nEthnic Demographics\\n2Global Workforce\\n51%\\n49%\\nOperating Committee\\n8%92%\\nManagement Team\\n19%\\n81%\\nCampus & Internship Class\\n55%\\n45%\\nMenWomen\\nU.S. EthnicU.S. White\\n2Numbers reect U.S. workforce only. \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n18PROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OU\\nR EMPLOYEES\\n\\nHiring Great People \\nTo deliver exceptional service to our clients, customers and \\ncommunities, we aim to hire the best people. Diversity is a priority \\nthroughout our hiring process, and we seek candidates from a wide \\nrange of backgrounds and experiences for positions at all levels. \\nWe look to hire people who have the skills and expertise we need, \\nusing standard processes for assessing and selecting candidates.\\nBuilding a Strong and Diverse \\nTalent Pipeline\\nWe have a number of eorts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including \\ninitiatives focused on women, underrepresented ethnic groups, \\npeople with disabilities, veterans and others.\\nWe know that strengthening our pipeline of diverse future leaders \\nis essential, so we have campus recruiting programs that help us \\nconnect with diverse candidates for internships and post-graduation \\nroles as part of our Emerging Talent Program (ETP), which \\ncomplements existing recruiting eorts. The ETP team oversees a \\nrange of employment opportunities for cognitively, experientially \\nand traditionally diverse individuals who are often underrepresented \\n\\nin typical talent pipelines. To support our recruitment eorts, we \\nalso have structured partnerships with key diversity organizations, \\nand we have long-standing relationships with Historically Black \\nColleges and Universities (HBCUs). In 2019, our rm was the top \\noverall employer at three HBCUs: Howard University, Morehouse \\nCollege and Spelman College.  \\nIn 2019, we continued to maintain best-in-class diversity hiring \\nfor our 2020 intern class, which was 47% female globally and in \\nthe U.S., 13% black and 16% Hispanic. This included eorts as \\n\\npart of our Advancing Black Pathways (ABP) initiative (see p. 21). \\nWe are equally focused on diversity in our experienced hiring, \\nwhich is delivering results. In 2019, for example, more than \\n55% of the Managing Directors we hired were diversedened \\nby groups of ethnicity and race, as outlined by the U.S. Census \\nBureau, and inclusive of women globallyan increase of nearly \\n15% compared to 2018. \\nCreating More Inclusive Inroads to \\nCareers at Our Firm\\nOur emphasis is on hiring people with the skills we need, not \\nparticular degrees. In fact, in 2019 more than 75% of the jobs \\nposted by JPMorgan Chase in the U.S. did not require a bachelors \\ndegree. While our rm continues to value four-year college and \\nadvanced degrees, we are also increasingly turning to new and \\nmore diverse sources to recruit the talent we need. One way \\nwe are doing this is by partnering with community colleges and \\nrecruiting those with associate degrees. We are also looking to \\napprenticeship programs, bootcamps and other partners to create \\nmore inroads to careers at our rm. For example, through our ETP \\n\\nportfolio we oer a range of apprenticeships and other entry-level \\nskill development opportunities. \\nThrough our Second Chance initiative, we launched an eort to \\nexpand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to \\npursue careers at JPMorgan Chase (see p. 21). This means qualied \\napplicants with criminal histories receive the same consideration \\nas any other applicant, and in 2019 it resulted in approximately \\n3,000 people with criminal backgrounds hiredroughly 10% of our \\nnew hires. We also launched a pilot program to further build our \\n\\npipeline for hiring people with criminal histories. \\nTraining and \\nCareer Development  \\nSupporting our employees professional development is a core \\nfocus of our human capital strategy. We invest approximately \\n$200 million a year in tools and training programs to help our \\nemployees build their knowledge, skills and experience. And, \\nin 2019, we delivered nearly 10 million hours of training to \\nemployees across the globe on topics including business processes \\nand products, leadership and professional development, risk \\nand compliance and technology, among others. In addition to \\nour internal training eorts, we provide tuition assistance to \\nemployees who are seeking to further build their skills. \\nWe also support employees by facilitating career advancement and \\nmobility within the rm. In 2019, we lled 42% of all positions and \\n67% of our most senior-level roles with internal candidates.\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n19\\nDelivering Best-in-Class \\nLeadership Training\\nLeadership Edge is our rmwide initiative to enable leaders at \\nall levels to grow and succeed throughout their careers.

By the end of 2019, 74% of our \\n\\n40,000 managers had attended one or more programs since the \\n\\nintroduction of Leadership Edge in 2015. \\nInvesting in New Skilling\\nWe are creating more paths for career mobility and preparing \\n\\nour employees to adapt to the trends that are transforming \\n\\njobs at our rm through a concerted focus on new skilling. The \\n\\nemployees in the roles that will be most aected by technological \\n\\nchangessuch as our operations and entry-level positionsare a \\n\\nhighly diverse employee population. Providing these individuals \\n\\nwith opportunities to build skills that facilitate career mobility \\n\\nand improve retention is, therefore, a key part of our strategy to \\n\\nadvance diversity and inclusion within our rm.   \\nWe are committed to providing employees with opportunities for \\nongoing development and career advancement. In 2019, through \\n\\nour Lifelong Learning program, we launched New Skills at Work \\n\\nto address talent needs across the rm. We have proactively \\n\\ndened business-critical future skillssuch as data and tech \\n\\nliteracy, analytical thinking and project managementand we are \\n\\ndeveloping and expanding access to opportunities for our people \\n\\nto build the identied skills. The New Skills at Work program \\n\\nwill support employees as they navigate changes and compete \\n\\nfor emerging jobs at JPMorgan Chase. The goal is to expand the \\n\\nprogram in phases to all of our employees. \\nIn addition, through our Skills of the Future online curriculum, \\nwe are helping employees increase their digital uency. In 2019, \\n\\nnearly 20,000 unique users took part in one of our Data and Tech \\n\\nLiteracy course oerings. And through our Power-Up Learning \\n\\nJourney, our rm trained over 10,000 of our tellers, facilitating \\n\\ntheir career progression and graduation to Associate Bankers.\\nSkills-Based Volunteering\\nOur rm leverages the talent of our people to maximize \\n\\nthe impact of our philanthropic programs. In 2019, 325 \\n\\nemployees from 14 countries contributed nearly 20,000 \\n\\nhours working with about 70 nonprots through the \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase Service Corps, our signature skills-\\n\\nbased program through which employees volunteer their \\n\\nskills and expertise to help our nonprot partners build \\n\\ncapacity. And, through our Force for Good program, \\n\\n1,300 employee volunteers gave nearly 60,000 hours of \\n\\ntheir time to develop sustainable tech solutions for 200 \\n\\nnonprot organizations. \\nIn addition to these programs, we provide a range of \\nother opportunities for our employees to volunteer \\n\\ntheir expertise to support the communities we serve. \\n\\nIn 2019, many employees around the world lent their \\n\\nknowledge and time helping drive more inclusive growth, \\n\\nfrom advising women-led businesses and mission-driven \\n\\nntech entrepreneurs to mentoring young people from \\n\\ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\\nA Workplace for \\nEveryone\\nWe want to be an employer of choice for people from all \\nbackgrounds and experiences, and a place where all employees \\n\\nfeel like they belong. By striving to create an inclusive work \\n\\nenvironment that supports all heritages, cultures, abilities, work \\n\\nstyles and lifestyles, our goal is to attract and retain the best \\n\\npeople and be positioned to meet the diverse needs of our clients, \\n\\ncustomers and communities. \\nWe continually work to promote a culture of respect that allows \\nevery employee to feel safe and empowered at work. Our \\nEqual \\n\\nOpportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Statement\\nwhich we made publicly available on our website in early 2020\\n\\nsets forth our policies and expectations for our employees, and \\n\\nall employees are required to take anti-harassment awareness \\n\\ntraining.

For example, \\nthe Hispanic Executive Forum serves as a senior collective voice \\nfor the Hispanic and Latino community and supports the Adelante \\nBRG and other Hispanic leadership forums across the rms lines \\nof business; engages with external organizations; and supports the \\nrms campus hiring, new employee on-boarding and retention and \\ndevelopment eorts among the Hispanic and Latino community. \\n\\nThe Asian Executive Forum similarly partners with the AsPIRE BRG \\nand supports the rms commitment to the Asian American and \\nPacic Islander community through recruitment, development, \\nadvancement and external engagement. \\nHere are some other examples of how our rm is taking a \\ndeliberate approach to supporting and investing in the success of \\nparticular communities: \\nChampioning Women\\nIn recent years, we have signicantly expanded our Women \\n\\non the Move initiative, which we originally launched in 2013 \\nto provide women at all levels of our rm with a platform to \\nexchange ideas and support their career development. Today, the \\nprogram focuses not only on women inside our rm but also on \\nclients and customers through three strategic pillars: expanding \\nwomen-run businesses, improving womens nancial health and \\nempowering womens career growth (see p. 14). We also continue \\nto support womens advancement within the rm. As of the end \\nof 2019, women made up 50% of our Operating Committee. \\n\\nIn addition, we are expanding our eorts to support working \\nparents and families (see p. 23). \\nInvesting in the Black Community\\nIn 2019, we marked the third anniversary of our rms Advancing \\nBlack Leaders (ABL) strategy to increase representation of black \\ntalent across all of our businesses. While we have much more \\nto do, this strategy is delivering tangible results, especially \\nat senior levels of the rm. We expanded the ABL strategy to \\nour Europe, Middle East and Africa region, which resulted in \\nour doubling the number of black Managing Directors in those \\nregions between 2018 and 2019.  \\nWe also launched ABP in 2019, which builds on the success \\nof our internal ABL strategy and extends our commitment \\n\\nto helping black Americans achieve economic success in our \\ncommunities. This initiative combines the rms business and \\nphilanthropic resources to accelerate economic opportunity for \\nblack Americans by strengthening education and job training, \\ngrowing careers and building wealth. As part of this program, \\nwe committed to hiring more than 4,000 black students over \\nthe next ve years into apprenticeships, internships and post-\\ngraduation roles. In 2019our rst year working toward this \\ncommitmentwe achieved 25% of the target. \\nProviding Opportunities to \\nPeople with Disabilities\\nThe global Oce of Disability Inclusion (ODI) provides consistent \\nstandards and processes to better accommodate employees and \\nstrategic direction to the rm with a focus on recruiting, hiring \\nand advancing individuals with disabilities. As part of the rms \\ndisability inclusion and well-being strategy, we are also working \\nto reduce stigmas and dispel myths around mental illness in \\nthe workplace. This is Me, the rms ongoing mental health \\nawareness campaign, does just that through events, videos, \\ntoolkits and other resources. Nearly 100 employees have shared \\nstories about their mental health journeys on our corporate \\n\\nintranet. Additionally, about 80,000 employees leverage \\nmeQuilibrium, the rms stress and resilience program. Our goal \\nis to make JPMorgan Chase the employer of choice for people \\nwith disabilitiesboth visible and hiddenby removing barriers \\nand providing the right level of support when they need it. \\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n21\\nHiring and Supporting Veterans\\nOur rms Oce of Military and Veterans Aairs drives our \\nrmwide strategy to support veterans through employment, \\n\\nentrepreneurship and private-sector leadership on veteran talent. \\n\\nSince 2011, JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 15,000 U.S. \\n\\nveteransincluding over 1,200 in 2019 alonewith more than \\n\\n65% coming from diverse backgrounds. We oer internship and \\n\\nrotational entry programs to support the transition of military \\n\\npersonnel and veterans into the nancial services industry. We \\n\\nsupport our veteran employees through mentorship programs, \\n\\nacclimation and development initiatives, recognition events and \\n\\nother programs to help bridge the gap between military and \\n\\ncorporate cultures. Additionally, we oer paid military leave for all \\n\\ntypes of military service. \\nSupporting Our \\nEmployees\\nOur rm is committed to supporting our employees, including their \\nphysical, emotional and nancial well-being. \\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we put this commitment \\ninto action by taking steps to protect and support our \\n\\nemployees and their families. We implemented alternative work \\n\\narrangements and reinforced both personal and oce hygiene \\n\\nmeasures to keep our employees and clients safe by modifying \\n\\nbusiness operations, staggering shifts, changing seating, closing \\n\\nbuildings to nonessential visitors and providing additional \\n\\nequipment where possible. \\nWe are continuing to pay branch employees for their regularly \\nscheduled hours, even if their hours are reduced or their branch is \\n\\ntemporarily closed. We are encouraging employees to stay home \\n\\nwhen appropriate by providing 14 days of full pay for precautionary \\n\\nsituations. In addition, for employees who felt they were higher \\n\\nrisk and could not work, we provided an extended leave through \\n\\nMay 2, 2020. And we provided ve additional paid days o for all \\n\\nemployees to help them manage personal issues, such as dependent \\n\\ncare, childcare or other needs. In addition, to help meet challenges \\n\\nrelated to issues like childcare and transportation, we are making \\n\\na special payment of up to $1,000 to full- and part-time employees \\n\\nwhose jobs require them to continue working on-site and generally \\n\\nhave annual cash compensation of less than $60,000.\\nSupporting the LGBT+ Community in \\nOur Workplace and Beyond\\nOur global PRIDE BRG, which focuses on the community who \\nidentify as LGBT+ and allies, had nearly 24,000 members in \\n\\n2019, up 35% from the year prior. In 2019, we also created \\n\\nour LGBT+ Executive Forum, a group of Out LGBT+ Managing \\n\\nDirectors and Executive Directors across 13 countries, to \\n\\ndrive increased engagement and visibility of our LGBT+ \\n\\nsenior leaders and advance topics important to our LGBT+ \\n\\ncommunity. In recent years, our rm has taken a number of \\n\\nsteps to better meet the needs of this employee population. \\n\\nFor example, we have improved family planning benets and \\n\\ntransgender medical benets for LGBT+ employees, as well as \\n\\nrolled out same-sex partner benets and gender reassignment \\n\\nsurgery coverage in certain geographies. In recognition of our \\n\\nworkplace practices, JPMorgan Chase has received a 100% \\n\\nscore on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index \\n\\nevery year since its inception 18 years ago.\\nOur rms eorts to advance equality and acceptance for those \\nwho identify as LGBT+ do not stop with our own workforce; \\n\\nwe are also lending our voice to eorts in our communities. \\n\\nIn 2019, for example, we signed public statements in support \\n\\nof marriage equality in Japan and Hong Kong, as well as a \\n\\nU.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in support of LGBT+ workers \\n\\nseeking to be protected from discrimination under existing \\n\\nfederal civil rights laws. We also engage with and support \\n\\nexternal LGBT+ organizations around the world.\\n Employee Compensation and Benets\\nWe oer competitive compensation and comprehensive benets. \\n\\nWe have governance mechanisms, systems and controls in place \\n\\nthat are intended to provide our employees equitable pay for the \\n\\nwork that they do, regardless of who they are. In recent years we \\n\\nincreased wages for U.S. employees at the lower end of our pay \\n\\nscale by 10% on average, ranging from between $15 and $18 \\n\\nper hour. \\nOur benets package includes health care coverage, retirement \\nbenets, life and disability insurance, wellness and employee \\n\\nassistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, \\n\\ntuition reimbursement programs and more. We consciously direct \\n\\nour benet spend toward lower-wage earners and provide those \\n\\nemployees with higher insurance subsidies and lower deductibles.  \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n22PROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\n\\nSupporting Working Parents and \\nFamily Building \\nWe oer parental and adoption leave programs with a minimum \\nof 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave for employees who are \\n\\nprimary caregivers. In 2019, we increased the amount of paid leave \\n\\nwe provide to nonprimary caregivers following the birth or adoption \\n\\nplacement of a child to a minimum of six weeks, up from two weeks. \\nWe also help our employees build families through our medical \\nbenets program, which includes coverage for infertility, as well as \\n\\nthrough policies such as adoption assistance and surrogacy benets. \\n\\nIn 2019, we expanded fertility benets to individuals without a \\n\\nmedical diagnosis of infertility and we increased nancial support \\n\\nfor surrogacy.  \\nWe have exible work options to support parents and others who \\nneed alternative work schedules, and we provide backup childcare \\n\\nin select markets and other assistance to working parents. In 2019, \\n\\nwe increased our support for nursing mothers by launching a new \\n\\nlactation consulting program and breast milk shipping options for \\n\\nour employees who are traveling. Since 2013, we have recruited \\n\\ntalent through the ReEntry Program, which is a competitive \\n\\nfellowship for individuals who are returning to the workforce after \\n\\nhaving taken a career break for at least two years for personal \\n\\nreasons, including, but not limited to, caring for family members \\n\\nwho are young, ill or elderly.  \\nEncouraging Health and Wellness\\nWe oer a comprehensive wellness program that includes a range \\n\\nof resources to empower and inspire our employees to manage \\n\\nand improve their health. Globally, we have 34 on-site health and \\n\\nwellness centers, and more than half of our U.S. employees have \\n\\naccess to these centers. We oer all benets-eligible employees \\n\\nand their covered spouses/domestic partners access to annual \\n\\nwellness assessments and screenings to help our employees \\n\\nidentify potential or existing health risks. In 2019, 82% of enrolled \\n\\nemployees and 71% of spouses/domestic partners completed both \\n\\na wellness assessment and screening. \\nDuring the year, we continued to expand our programs to raise \\nawareness and reduce stigmas around mental illness and provide \\n\\nrelevant support to employees. All employees have access to our \\n\\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides condential \\n\\ncounseling and support as well as manager consultationseither \\n\\nthrough on-site counselors or our extended provider network. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we have 13 on-site clinical providers focusing on \\n\\nmental health and in 2019 we launched on-site EAP support and \\n\\ncounseling in London. We also launched new resources including \\n\\nvideos, a Manager and Employee Toolkit and a resource library on \\n\\nthe disease of addiction. \\nAssessing Pay Equity\\nWe conduct periodic pay equity reviews at all levels. In 2019, \\n\\nin aggregate, women globally were paid 99% of what men \\n\\nwere paid and U.S. minorities were paid more than 99% of \\n\\nwhat nonminorities were paid, taking into account factors \\n\\nsuch as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography. \\n\\nWe are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce. \\n\\nHowever, we also know that women and minorities still are \\n\\nnot represented in as many senior management positions \\n\\nas men and nonminorities. Despite the signicant progress \\n\\nwe have made, we are taking a variety of actions focused \\n\\non hiring, retaining, developing and advancing women and \\n\\nminorities, especially at more senior levels. \\nAdditional Online Resources\\nAnnual Report\\n Awards and Recognition\\nBusiness Principles Careers at JPMorgan Chase\\n\\n Compensation & Management Development Committee\\n\\n COVID-19 Response\\n\\n Diversity and Inclusion\\n\\n Equal Opportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment \\nStatement\\n How We Do BusinessThe Report\\n\\n People and Culture\\n\\n Proxy Statement\\nFor additional inf\\normation, please visit www.jpmorganchase.com/ESG\\n.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n23PROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\n\\nSupporting Our Communities\\nCompanies like ours have a responsibility to step up and help solve pressing challenges. \\nWhen communities do well, our rm does well. This conviction is reected in how JPMorgan \\n\\nChase endeavors to do business every day. We are investing in our customers, employees and \\n\\ncommunities around the world to break down barriers to opportunity and create an economy \\n\\nthat works for more people. \\nIn response to COVID-19, and in addition to eorts across the rm to support our customers and employees in need, we made an initial \\n$200 million commitment to assist those most aected by humanitarian challenges, as well as create sustainable and innovative solutions \\n\\nto help communities recover when the crisis subsides. This commitment included $150 million in low-cost capital to help underserved \\n\\nsmall businesses and nonprots access funding through community partners and a $50 million philanthropic investment to help address \\n\\nimmediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19. We will continue to focus on areas where we can leverage our core business, philanthropy \\n\\nand policy expertise to help the most vulnerable in the short and long term.\\nOur Approach\\nOur rm is combining our business and policy expertise, sustainable business practices, data, capital and global presence to advance \\n\\nsolutions aimed at improving peoples lives. Our approach is strategic and data driven, and we have developed, tested and continuously \\n\\nrene it on the ground in communities around the world.         \\nAdvancing Policy Solutions\\nPublic policy is a critical tool to scale the most innovative and \\n\\nimpactful approaches that bring about lasting change. In 2019, \\n\\nwe launched the JPMorgan Chase \\nPolicy\\nCenter to develop and \\nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions designed to  \\n\\ndrive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the world.\\nThe rst focus area for the \\nPolicy\\nCenter is advancing federal and \\nstate policy changes to remove barriers to employment for people \\nwith criminal backgrounds, such as banning the box on job \\n\\napplications and increasing access to education through Pell grants\\n\\nwhich provide nancial aid to low-income studentsfor people \\n\\nin prison. One in three Americans has a criminal record, which \\n\\nconstitutes a signicant barrier to employment for many people. \\n\\nProviding education, skills training and employment opportunities \\n\\nto people with arrest or conviction histories can have a huge impact. \\n\\nIt enables them to support their families, save money and secure \\n\\nstable housing. It also helps reduce recidivism, increase public \\n\\nsafety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. \\nAnother area of focus for the \\nPolicy\\nCenter is advancing local \\npolicy solutions that will enable more young peopleparticularly \\nthose who lack opportunityto access high-quality career \\n\\nreadiness programs that pave the way to well-paying jobs. And \\n\\nthe Policy\\nCenter will play an integral role as we respond to and \\nrecover from the impacts of COVID-19. \\nHarnessing the Power of Data\\nSound public policy is informed by timely, granular data. The \\n\\nJPMorgan Chase Institute is dedicated to delivering data-rich \\n\\nanalyses and expert insights for the public good. Our rm serves \\n\\n63 million households through our consumer banking business, \\n\\nand by leveraging the unique assets and proprietary data of the \\n\\nrm, the Institute provides policymakers, businesses and nonprot \\n\\nleaders with timely data and thoughtful analyses to help address \\n\\ncritical issues and advance global prosperity.\\nOur data allow us to better understand and answer important \\nquestions about the nancial health and resilience of U.S. \\n\\nconsumers, businesses and communities, as well as study labor and \\n\\nnancial markets. In 2019, the Institute shared valuable insights \\n\\nacross a range of areas, including how student loan payments \\n\\naect the nancial lives of 4.6 million families, how Miamis small \\n\\nbusinesses turn a prot yet have limited cash buers and how \\n\\nfamilies are weathering nancial volatility on a monthly basis.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n24SUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nOur Focus Areas\\nOur rm is focused on advancing inclusive growth where we have the ability to make a real and lasting impact. As the world faces the \\nhealth and economic consequences of COVID-19, we will lean into our core areas of expertise to support vulnerable individuals, small \\n\\nbusinesses and communities as they face nancial hardship and uncertain work opportunities, a shifting business landscape and increased \\n\\npressure to access or maintain aordable housing.\\nPreparing Workers for the Future of Work\\nTechnological change continues to transform the world of work. \\n\\nBy 2030, more than 30% of American workers and 375 million \\n\\nworkers globally will need to change jobs or upgrade their skills \\n\\nsignicantly to advance within the workforce. \\nIn 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced a $350 million investment \\nover ve years to equip young people and adults with the skills to \\n\\nsucceed in a rapidly changing economy. We are working to create \\n\\ngreater economic mobility and career pathways for workers \\n\\ninside our rm (see p. 20), as well as in our communities. This \\n\\nnew commitment includes $75 million to enable more young \\n\\npeople to get education and real-world work experiences. \\n\\nOur rst investment as part of this commitment was $7 \\n\\nmillion to support Denver, Colorados nationally recognized \\n\\nyouth apprenticeship program and scale it to connect more \\n\\nunderserved students to degrees and credentials aligned with \\n\\nin-demand careers. \\nThese investments build on our rms long-standing eorts \\nto support education, skills training and policy solutions that \\n\\nconnect job seekers to high-quality jobs in a changing economy. \\n\\nOver the past six years, we have helped more than 150,000 \\n\\npeople across 37 countries develop in-demand job skills. \\nSupporting Small Businesses\\nThrough our investments in communities around the world, we \\n\\nhave seen rsthand how underserved, minority entrepreneurs have \\n\\nthe power to lift up communities. Yet these populations often face \\n\\nunique barriers that inhibit their success. This is why our eorts \\n\\nfocus on unleashing their power as drivers of opportunity. \\nThrough the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, we have provided \\nminority entrepreneurs in Detroit, Chicago, the South Bronx, \\n\\nthe Bay Area and the Greater Washington region with access \\n\\nto capital, education and other resources. Through 2019, we \\n\\ncommitted over $17 million through the Entrepreneurs of Color \\n\\nFund, resulting in more than 475 loans that created or retained \\n\\nover 3,000 jobs.\\nCultivating Thriving Neighborhoods\\nHousing that individuals and families can aord, in proximity to \\n\\neconomic opportunity and basic services, is the cornerstone of \\n\\nvibrant and resilient neighborhoods. Producing, preserving and \\n\\nprotecting aordable housing is essential to our strategy for creating \\n\\nthriving neighborhoods. For example, as part of a $75 million \\n\\ncommitment to the Bay Area our rm announced in early 2020 \\n\\nthrough our \\nAdvancing\\nCities eort, we are investing $27 million \\nto develop and preserve aordable housing in San Francisco and \\n\\nOakland. This investment, which combines long-term, low-cost loans \\n\\nand philanthropic capital, will provide more aordable housing and \\n\\nprotect local residents from being displaced. \\nIn addition, we have hosted six Partnerships for Raising \\nOpportunity in Neighborhoods (PRO Neighborhoods) \\n\\ncompetitions, awarding more than $131 million to over 95 \\n\\ncommunity development nancial institutions across the \\n\\nU.S. As of 2019, the winners have raised over $870 million in \\n\\noutside capital and made over 35,000 loans worth over $475 \\n\\nmillion dedicated to low- and moderate-income communities. \\n\\nIn 2020, the PRO Neighborhoods Competition merged with our \\nAdvancing\\nCities Challenge to continue to source innovative and \\nsustainable solutions and address persistent problems facing \\n\\ncommunities (see p. 27).\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n25SUPPORTING OUR \\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nStrengthening Financial Health\\nSound nancial health is the foundation on which strong and \\nresilient households, communities and economies are built.

ReNew Power is Indias \\n\\nlargest renewable energy independent power producer, \\n\\nwith more than 8 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity \\n\\ncommissioned and under construction. The proceeds from the \\n\\nissue were used to renance some of ReNews existing debt and \\n\\nnance investments in new green power projects.  \\nFinancing and risk management. \\nJPMorgan Chase provides \\n\\nnancing and risk management solutions to support clients \\n\\nrenewable energy projects and to facilitate new energy, \\n\\ntechnology, transportation, waste management and water \\n\\ntreatment innovations. For example, since 2003, JPMorgan \\n\\nChase has committed or arranged over $24 billion in tax equity \\n\\nnancing for wind, solar and geothermal energy projects in the \\n\\nU.S., including $3 billion for wind and solar projects in 2019\\n.  Providing advisory services. \\nJPMorgan Chase advises clients \\n\\non strategic transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions, \\n\\ninitial public oerings and capital raising. In 2019, the rm \\n\\nacted as a bookrunner on the initial public oering for Sunnova \\n\\nEnergy International, Inc. [NYSE: NOVA], a residential solar and \\n\\nenergy service provider that serves over 78,000 customers in \\n\\nmore than 20 U.S. states and territories. \\nAdvancing sustainability through research. \\nWe leverage \\n\\nour research capabilities to advance sustainability and ESG \\n\\ninvestment strategies. In 2019, our rm published approximately \\n\\n115 reports assessing the macro- and sector-level impact of \\n\\nclimate change and outlining dierent approaches to integrating \\n\\nESG into investment strategies. In addition, through J.P. Morgan \\n\\nESG (JESG)a suite of indices we launched in 2018 that integrate \\n\\nESG factors into a composite benchmarkwe provide scoring \\n\\ncoverage for over 4,500 global corporate issuers across 14 \\n\\nsectors and nearly 300 sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns. The \\n\\nESGQ quantitative metric for stock selection helps investors pick \\n\\nstocks that prioritize ESG factors and covers a universe of 5,124 \\n\\nstocks globally. In 2020, J.P. Morgan expanded its dedicated ESG \\n\\nresearch capabilities, adding ESG specialists in both our Equity \\n\\nResearch and Global Index Research groups.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n29INVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nAsset & Wealth Management\\nSustainable investing is a priority within our AWM business, which \\nhas $2.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and works \\n\\nwith institutional, wholesale and professional clients around the \\n\\nworld to invest capital to achieve their nancial goals. \\nOur Asset Management business believes that incorporation of \\nmaterial ESG issues into the investment process can help to deliver \\n\\nenhanced risk-adjusted returns over the long term and it has \\n\\ncommitted to integrate ESG factors across all eligible strategies. \\n\\nBuilding on ESG integration, we also provide a range of dedicated \\n\\nsustainable investing products that aim to deliver nancial returns, \\n\\nalign portfolios with client values and help meet a diverse set of \\n\\ngoals. As of year-end 2019, our Asset Management business had \\n\\nmore than $1.3 trillion of AUM in ESG-integrated strategies and $2.4 \\n\\nbillion in our suite of 11 dedicated sustainable investing products.  \\nAs a duciary of our clients assets, we are committed to making \\nsure that the companies in which we invest focus on responsible \\n\\nallocation of capital and long-term value creation with an \\n\\ninvestment-led, expert-driven investment stewardship approach. \\n\\nOur Asset Management business supports and participates in \\n\\nindustry advocacy eorts aimed at addressing climate change, \\n\\nsuch as the TCFD and the United Nations-supported Principles \\n\\nfor Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative. And, in 2020, Asset \\n\\nManagement joined the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative to \\n\\nenhance its engagement with companies on climate-related risks \\n\\nand opportunities.  \\nOur Wealth Management business is also working to expand and \\nenhance how we help clients who want to pursue sustainable \\n\\ninvesting within their portfolios. Through white papers and other \\n\\nresources, we support our clients interests and share insights \\n\\non sustainability topics such as sustainable agriculture, circular \\n\\neconomy, electric vehicles and clean energy. \\nAcross equities, xed income, alternatives and multi-asset portfolios, \\nWealth Management has 80 investment strategies globally geared \\n\\ntoward sustainable investing, with $7.3 billion in AUM as of year-end \\n\\n2019. These strategies span multiple approaches, including ESG \\n\\nintegration, exclusionary screening, thematic investing and impact \\n\\ninvesting. We continue to develop tools to help clients achieve their \\n\\nsustainable investing goals and new opportunities for our clients \\n\\nto participate in impact investing funds. For example, in 2019 we \\n\\noered a new investment opportunity to Wealth Management clients \\n\\nthrough RRG Capital Management, which is an impact-focused fund \\n\\nmanager thatin partnership with The Nature Conservancy as a \\n\\ntechnical advisorraised a fund that aims to invest across multiple \\n\\nsynergistic themes such as water, farm acquisition and development, \\n\\nhabitat conservation and renewable energy and storage. \\nExpanding Our Firms Capacity \\n and Capabilities\\nTo support JPMorgan Chases commitment to advance the \\n\\nSDGs and meet growing client demand, we are expanding \\n\\nour rms capacity and capabilities in emerging markets. \\n\\nIn 2020, we launched the J.P. Morgan Development \\n\\nFinance Institution (JPM DFI), which is focused on scaling \\n\\nup nancing for developing countries. In consultation with \\n\\nleading development institutions, JPM DFI has created a \\n\\nmethodology intended to identify and qualify business \\n\\nactivities and opportunities that generate both nancial \\n\\nand developmental returns.\\nOur CIB business has established an ESG Solutions group \\nto advise our clients on a variety of ESG and climate-\\n\\nrelated topics. By bringing together specialists in \\n\\nsustainability and nancial markets, this group will serve \\n\\nas a center of expertise to help our clients navigate the \\n\\nenergy transition and respond to increased interest in \\n\\nESG investing. The group will also lead the development \\n\\nof our sustainable product oerings, enabling our clients \\n\\nto improve their sustainability credentials and access \\n\\nESG-focused capital. In addition, we have assembled a new \\n\\nEnergy Transition Team to provide strategic and nancial \\n\\nadvice to corporate clients on mergers and acquisitions \\n\\nthat support carbon optimization objectives.\\nFinally, we have also established a Client Engagement \\nteam focused on driving high-impact conversations on \\n\\ncorporate responsibility and ESG-related topics with \\n\\nclients across our lines of business. \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n30INVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nManaging Risk\\nAssessing our clients approach to, and performance on, \\nenvironmental and social matters is an important component \\n\\nof the rms risk management process. It helps us make more \\n\\ninformed decisions and safeguards our reputation. It also enables \\n\\nus to oer our clients information and guidance on best practices \\n\\nwhen they are seeking to access capital markets, provide \\n\\ndisclosures or improve sustainability practices. \\nThe rms publicly available Environmental and Social Policy \\nFramework (Framework) provides an overview of our approach \\n\\nto evaluating risks posed by environmental and social matters, \\n\\nincluding certain activities that we will not nance, and sectors \\n\\nand activities subject to environmental and social due diligence. \\n\\nIn 2020, we updated our Framework to expand restrictions on \\n\\nnancing for coal mining and coal-red power and to prohibit \\n\\nproject nancing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic. \\nOur due diligence eorts are led by a dedicated environmental \\nand social risk management group. In 2019, approximately 2,100 \\n\\ntransactions were referred to this team for review because a \\n\\npotential environmental or social risk was identied. These \\n\\nincluded loans, debt underwriting, equity underwriting and \\n\\nadvisory services. Detailed due diligence was undertaken on \\n\\nroughly one-third of the referred transactions. \\nJPMorgan Chase participates in or has adopted various \\ninternationally recognized principles that help guide our \\n\\neorts on environmental and social risk management, \\n\\nincluding the Equator Principles. Further information about our \\n\\nimplementation of the Equator Principles and other principles is \\n\\navailable in our \\nFramework\\n. Expanding Our Focus on Climate Change\\nIn 2019, we published our rst climate report that was guided \\n\\nby recommendations of the TCFD. Our rm has served as a \\n\\nmember of TCFD since it was established. Our report discusses our \\n\\napproach toward managing climate-related risks and how we are \\n\\ncapitalizing on the opportunities that arise through a transition \\n\\nto a lower-carbon economy. Since our report was published, we \\n\\nhave taken a number of steps to integrate climate factors into our \\n\\nrmwide processes for identifying, assessing and managing risks. \\n\\nFor example:\\nWe created a dedicated risk team focused on climate.\\nWe integrated climate-related risks into the processes the rm \\nuses to identify, assess and review the most material risks to \\n\\nour business.We are evaluating stress testing approaches to deepen our \\n\\nunderstanding of the relationship between climate change and \\n\\nnancial impact to our rm.\\nWe continue to engage on policy through industry forums, \\n\\nsuch as the Climate Financial Risk Forumestablished by the \\n\\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory \\n\\nAuthority (PRA) of the Bank of Englandas a member of the \\n\\nScenario Analysis working group.\\nPolicy Engagement\\nAddressing complex global challenges, including climate change, \\n\\nrequires collaboration and collective action. We participate in a \\n\\nvariety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability within \\n\\nour industry and across the corporate sector broadly. As part of \\n\\nthis, we share our expertise on issues at the nexus of nance and \\n\\nsustainability, and learn from other companies and organizations.\\nIn early 2020, for example, JPMorgan Chase joined the Climate \\nLeadership Council (CLC), a think tank that is promoting a \\n\\nbipartisan roadmap for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend \\n\\nframework for the U.S. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase play \\n\\nan important role nancing the energy transition necessary to \\n\\naddress climate change, and we believe the CLCs roadmap is a \\n\\nstep toward advancing a bipartisan conversation about concrete \\n\\npolicy solutions. \\nTransparency and \\nReporting\\nJPMorgan Chase is committed to providing stakeholders with \\ninformation about our approach to and performance on ESG \\n\\ntopics. This annual ESG Report, which summarizes our work on key \\n\\nissues, is one of the primary ways we do that. For the rst time, \\n\\nthis ESG Report is informed by SASB and includes a separate index, \\n\\navailable on \\nour website\\n, which maps our rms disclosures against \\nthe SASB indicators relevant to the sectors in which our rm \\n\\noperates. Our ESG Report also continues to be informed by GRI.    \\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n31\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nStrengthening Community Resilience to Climate Change  \\nAround the world, communities are struggling to manage the impacts of natural disasters, such as severe weather and wildres, \\nmany of which could be exacerbated by climate change. These events are expected to grow over timeand to disproportionately \\n\\nimpact the most vulnerable populations. While our rm has a robust operational resilience program and a long track record of \\n\\nsupporting customers and communities after disaster strikes, we are taking an increasingly coordinated approach to helping \\n\\ncommunities prepare to withstand these threats.\\nIn 2019, we launched community resilience pilots in South Florida and Northern California. Informed by community input about the \\nmain challenges in responding to disasters, our rm committed nearly $3 million in philanthropic capital to help these communities \\n\\ndevelop new informational tools, models of engagement and research that will help prepare them to be more resilient in the face of \\n\\nthe next disaster. Going forward, we are applying insights from these pilots to enhance our support. This includes working to expand \\n\\nour eorts to more communities that are vulnerable, as well as better aligning our community resilience strategy with immediate \\n\\ndisaster relief eorts.\\nOperational Sustainability\\nMinimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations continues to be an important part of our global sustainability strategy. \\n\\nIt also helps us to reduce costs and strengthen the rms resilience. Given the nature of our business, our direct environmental impacts \\n\\nstem primarily from the operation of more than 5,400 corporate buildings, retail bank branches and data centers, including the electricity \\n\\nneeded to power those sites.\\nIncreasing Renewable Energy\\nIncreasing our support for renewable energy is a core part of \\n\\nour operational sustainability strategy. In addition to reducing \\n\\nenergy consumption by implementing energy-ecient lighting \\n\\nand other technologies, we are undertaking a range of actions, \\n\\nincluding: \\nInstalling on-site renewable energy \\nat retail branches and \\ncommercial buildings;\\nExecuting Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green \\n\\npower supply contracts \\nto support the development of new \\nrenewable energy projects on grids from which we purchase \\n\\nenergy; and\\nPurchasing Renewable Energy Certicates (RECs) \\nto green \\n\\nour electricity supply.\\nWe will meet our 100% renewable energy commitment in 2020 \\n\\nby generating and purchasing energy and corresponding RECs \\n\\nin an amount equivalent to the total megawatt (MW) hours of \\n\\nelectricity that JPMorgan Chase consumes globally over the \\n\\nyear. The RECs we purchase will be sourced in accordance with \\n\\nRE100an initiative of The Climate Group and CDP to accelerate \\n\\nthe worlds transition to renewablesof which JPMorgan Chase \\n\\nis a member. Over time, our goal is to meet our commitment \\n\\non an annual basis in a way that maximizes impact by bringing \\n\\nmore renewable energy onto the grid.\\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. \\nEnvironmental Social & Governance Report\\n32\\nINVESTING IN \\n OUR EMPLOYEES\\nPROMOTING SOUND \\nGOVERNANCE\\nSERVING OUR \\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\nSUPPORTING OUR \\n\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nINTRODUCTION\\nADVANCING\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nHighlights of our progress in 2019 include: \\nCompleting LED lighting retrots at 4,300 branches and 50 \\ncommercial oces, which will result in up to 50% reduction in \\n\\nlighting energy consumption for each building;\\nInstalling energy-ecient building management systems at \\n\\n2,600 branches;  \\nPurchasing the equivalent of more than 10% of our global \\n\\nannual electricity consumption from a 100.5 MW wind farm in \\n\\nTexas and over 15% of the electricity we consume annually in \\n\\nIndia through a solar PPA in Bangalore;\\nCompleting on-site solar installations at commercial oces, \\n\\nincluding the construction of a 3.6 MW rooftop and carport \\n\\nsystem in Arizona and a 2.8 MW rooftop system at our Polaris \\n\\ncampus in Ohio, which is one of the worlds largest commercial \\n\\ninstallations of bifacial solar modules; andConstructing rooftop solar systems at approximately 200 \\n\\nbranches in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, which are on track \\n\\nto be completed in 2020. \\nOsetting Emissions from \\nEmployee Travel  \\nIn 2019, we oset 100% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \\nfrom employee air and rail travel.\\n3 We achieved this by purchasing \\n189,327 Veried Emission Reduction (VER) credits from forest \\n\\nmanagement projects in the U.S., such as Hawk Mountain \\n\\nSanctuary in Pennsylvania.
